    "description": "While in Paris on business, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon receives an urgent late-night phone call: the elderly curator of the Louvre has been murdered inside the museum. Near the body, police have found a baffling cipher. While working to solve the enigmatic riddle, Langdon is stunned to discover it leads to a trail of clues hidden in the works of Da Vinci -- clues visible for all to see -- yet ingeniously disguised by the painter. Langdon joins forces with a gifted French cryptologist, Sophie Neveu, and learns the late curator was involved in the Priory of Sion -- an actual secret society whose members included Sir Isaac Newton, Botticelli, Victor Hugo, and Da Vinci, among others. In a breathless race through Paris, London, and beyond, Langdon and Neveu match wits with a faceless powerbroker who seems to anticipate their every move. Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the labyrinthine puzzle in time, the Priory's ancient secret -- and an explosive historical truth -- will be lost forever. THE DA VINCI CODE heralds the arrival of a new breed of lightning-paced, intelligent thriller…utterly unpredictable right up to its stunning conclusion.",

    "description": "Harvard professor Robert Langdon receives an urgent late-night phone call while on business in Paris: the elderly curator of the Louvre, Jacques Sauni're, has been brutally murdered inside the museum. Alongside the body, police have found a series of baffling codes. As Langdon and a gifted French cryptologist, Sophie Neveu, begin to sort through the bizarre riddles, they are stunned to find a trail that leads to the works of Leonardo Da Vinci - and suggests the answer to a mystery that stretches deep into the vault of history. Langdon suspects the late curator was involved in the Priory of Sion - a centuries old secret society - and has sacrificed his life to protect the Priory's most sacred trust: the location of a vastly important religious relic hidden for centuries. But it now appears that Opus Dei, a clandestine sect that has long plotted to seize the Prirory's secret, has now made its move. Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the labyrinthine code and quickly assemble the pieces of the puzzle, the Priory's secret - and a stunning historical truth - will be lost forever. Breaking the mould of traditional suspense novels, The DA VINCI CODE is simultaneously lightning-paced, intelligent and intricately layered with remarkable research and detail. And in this exclusive edition Dan Brown allows the reader behind the scenes of the novel which now incorporates over 150 photographs and illustrations throughout the text showing the rich historical tapestry from which he drew his inspiration. The visual sources which provide both the backdrop and the stimulus for the novel's action are revealed for the first time and uniquely complement the reading experience.",

This outreach book is designed so readers can give multiple copies to friends, family, coworkers—anyone who may be struggling with the misconceptions fostered by The Da Vinci Code.

In Breaking the Da Vinci Code: Answers to the Questions Everyone's Asking, Darrell Bock, Ph.D., responds to the novelist's claims using central ancient texts and answers the following questions: Who was Mary Magdalene? Was Jesus Married? Would Jesus Being Single be Un-Jewish? Do the So-Called Secret Gnostic Gospels Help Us Understand Jesus? What Is the Remaining Relevance of The Da Vinci Code? Darrell Bock's research uncovers the origins of these codes by focusing on the 325 years immediately following the birth of Christ, for the claims of The Da Vinci Code rise or fall on the basis of things emerging from this period. Breaking the Da Vinci Code, now available in trade paper, distinguishes fictitious entertainment from historical elements of the Christian faith. For by seeing these differences, one can break the Da Vinci code.",

    "description": "In Robert Ludlum's ground-breaking career, no other character so captured and held the world's imagination as Jason Bourne. He appeared in three of Robert Ludlum's own #1 bestselling novels - The Bourne Identity, The Bourne Supremacy, and The Bourne Ultimatum - and they remain amongst Ludlum's most-read and most-loved books to this day. Now, for the first time ever, the Estate of Robert Ludlum has acceded to the demands of readers around the world, turning to bestselling author Eric Van Lustbader to bring Jason Bourne back to life in a thrilling new novel. Jason Bourne is known and feared in the deadly world of covert-ops as one of the most highly skilled assassins for hire. Bourne, however, was merely an identity assumed by CIA agent David Webb, a personality implanted by the CIA to facilitate a dangerous operation, but one that threatened to subsume David Webb entirely. Years after the events of The Bourne Identity, Webb is no longer an active CIA agent and is now a professor of Eastern Studies at Georgetown University, living a quiet life, far from the dangers of his previous life. Until one day he finds himself the target of an assassin nearly as skilled as himself and is framed for the brutal murder of his two closest associates and friends. Fighting for his life against unseen assailants, as well as the full resources of the CIA who believe he has gone dangerously rogue, the Bourne identity asserts itself, leaving Jason Bourne in control. Now Bourne must use all his skills to stay alive as he battles against a determined assassin, the combined skills of the world's intelligence networks, and a shadowy figure in the background, skillfully manipulating events and people, in a far deadlier and more dangerous game than any of them realize.",

    "description": "In response to actual questions many people have asked him about angels and demons, well-known author and philosophy professor Peter Kreeft separates fact from fantasy and myth from reality as he answers 100 common questions about these spiritual beings. Based on a very popular college course he teaches on this subject, this book responds to the incredible amount of interest in angelic beings and attempts to clear up some of the misinformation abounding in the numerous books today on what we know about these mysterious spirits. Drawing on the Bible, traditional Church teaching and St. Thomas Aquinas, Kreeft gives straight, clear answers to the perennial and philosophical questions asked about angels and demons throughout time. In his typical lucid, profound and sometimes humorous style, Kreeft answers such questions as \"\"What are angels made of?\"\", \"\"How do angels communicate with God?\"\", \"\"How do angels communicate with us?\"\", \"\"Do demons, or devils, or evil spirits really exist?\"\" and many more. Includes angel art.",

Às vésperas do conclave que vai eleger o novo Papa, Langdon é chamado às pressas para analisar um misterioso símbolo marcado a fogo no peito de um físico assassinado em um grande centro de pesquisas na Suíça. Ele descobre indícios de algo inimaginável: a assinatura macabra no corpo da vítima é dos Illuminati, uma poderosa fraternidade que ressurgiu disposta a levar a cabo a lendária vingança contra a Igreja Católica. De posse de uma nova arma devastadora, roubada do centro de pesquisas, ela ameaça explodir a Cidade do Vaticano e matar os quatro cardeais mais cotados para a sucessão papal. A antiga sociedade ressurgiu disposta a levar a cabo a lendária vingança contra a Igreja Católica, seu inimigo mais odiado. De posse de uma nova arma devastadora, roubada do centro de pesquisas, ela ameaça explodir a Cidade do Vaticano e matar os quatro cardeais mais cotados para a sucessão papal. Correndo contra o tempo, Langdon voa para Roma junto com Vittoria Vetra, uma bela cientista italiana. Numa caçada frenética por criptas, igrejas e catedrais, os dois desvendam enigmas e seguem uma trilha que pode levar ao covil dos Illuminati - um refúgio secreto onde está a única esperança de salvação da Igreja nesta guerra entre ciência e religião. Em Anjos e Demônios, Dan Brown demonstra novamente sua habilidade de entremear suspense com fascinantes informações sobre ciência, religião e história da arte.",

Às vésperas do conclave que vai eleger o novo Papa, Langdon é chamado às pressas para analisar um misterioso símbolo marcado a fogo no peito de um físico assassinado em um grande centro de pesquisas na Suíça. O CÓDIGO DA VINCI Um assassinato dentro do Museu do Louvre, em Paris, traz à tona uma sinistra conspiração para revelar um segredo que foi protegido por uma sociedade secreta desde os tempos de Jesus Cristo. A vítima é o respeitado curador do museu, Jacques Saunière, um dos líderes dessa antiga fraternidade, o Priorado de Sião, que já teve como membros Leonardo da Vinci, Victor Hugo e Isaac Newton. O SÍMBOLO PERDIDO Em O símbolo perdido, Robert Langdon é convidado às pressas por seu amigo e mentor Peter Solomon – eminente maçom e filantropo – a dar uma palestra no Capitólio dos Estados Unidos. Ao chegar lá, descobre que caiu numa armadilha. Não há palestra nenhuma, Solomon está desaparecido e, ao que tudo indica, correndo grande perigo. Nas mãos de Dan Brown, Washington se revela tão fascinante quanto o Vaticano ou Paris. Em O Símbolo Perdido, ele desperta o interesse dos leitores por temas tão variados como ciência, noética, teoria das supercordas e grandes obras de arte, os desafiando a abrir a mente para novos conhecimentos. INFERNO No meio da noite, o renomado simbologista Robert Langdon acorda de um pesadelo, num hospital. Desorientado e com um ferimento à bala na cabeça, ele não tem a menor ideia de como foi parar ali. Ao olhar pela janela e reconhecer a silhueta do Palazzo Vecchio, em Florença, Langdon tem um choque. Ele nem se lembra de ter deixado os Estados Unidos. Na verdade, não tem nenhuma recordação das últimas 36 horas. ORIGEM Robert Langdon, o famoso professor de Simbologia de Harvard, chega ao ultramoderno Museu Guggenheim de Bilbao para assistir a uma apresentação sobre uma grande descoberta que promete abalar os alicerces de todas as religiões e mudar para sempre a face da ciência. O anfitrião é o futurólogo e bilionário Edmond Kirsch, que se tornou conhecido por suas previsões audaciosas e invenções de alta tecnologia. O brilhante ex-aluno de Langdon está prestes a revelar uma incrível revolução no conhecimento, algo que vai responder a duas perguntas fundamentais da existência humana: DE ONDE VIEMOS? PARA ONDE VAMOS?",

The '60s James Bond spoof Casino Royale is a psychedelic, multi-storylined extravaganza packed with star names, including Peter Sellers, Woody Allen, David Niven, Ursula Andress and Orson Welles. Poorly received at the time of its original release, it has since come to be regarded as a cult classic. In this book, noted television and film researcher Michael Richardson gives the most detailed and comprehensive account ever published of the making of this extraordinary blockbuster, which got so out of control that it became arguably one of the most chaotic productions in cinema history - and certainly the most bizarre James Bond film ever! A series of guides to some of the most talked-about films ever produced. From classics and acclaimed features to lesser-known or overlooked works, but all deserving of critical appraisal. Telos Movie Classics are the perfect way to gain a greater insight into the films you love.",

Geheimdienstchef M schickt Bond auf eine Mission, um einen russischen Agenten namens \"Le Chiffre\" auszuschalten. Er soll ihn am Baccarat-Tisch ruinieren und so seine sowjetischen Auftraggeber zwingen, ihn in den \"Ruhestand\" zu schicken. Zunächst scheint es so, als ob das Glück Bond hold ist - Le Chiffre hat eine Pechsträhne. Doch manche Leute weigern sich einfach, nach den Regeln zu spielen, und die Anziehungskraft, die eine schöne Agentin auf Bond ausübt, führt ihn zuerst ins Unglück und dann zu einem unerwarteten Retter ... Jeder kennt sie: die teils stark von den Vorlagen abweichenden Verfilmungen der James-Bond-Romane. Pünktlich zum 50-jährigen Jubliäum der Filmreihe gilt es die Ian-Fleming-Originale erstmals im \"Director's Cut\" zu entdecken! Eine der größten Filmikonen überhaupt wird 50 Jahre alt! Passend dazu kommt Ende 2012 der 23. Teil der Saga mit dem Titel \"Skyfall\" in die Kinos! Cross Cult schließt sich den Jubilaren des Mythos mit einer Wiederentdeckung der meisterhaft erzählten Agenten- und Spionageromane aus der Feder Ian Flemings an und beginnt die schrittweise Veröffentlichung aller James-Bond-Originalromane. Endlich wird es möglich sein, Titel wie \"Goldfinger\", \"Thunderball\" oder \"You Only Live Twice\" komplett in ungekürzten Übersetzungen und mit den ursprünglichen Kapitelabschnitten und -überschriften zu lesen. Es verspricht eine einzigartige James-Bond-Bibliothek zu werden, die dazu einlädt, dem Kult um den britischen Gentleman-Geheimdienstler mit der \"Lizenz zum Töten\" auf den Grund zu gehen.",

    "description": "In 1984, Tom Clancy released his blockbuster novel, The Hunt for Red October, an edge-of-your seat thriller that skyrocketed him into international notoriety. The inspiration for that novel came from an obscure report by a US naval officer of a mutiny aboard a Soviet warship in the Baltic Sea. The Hunt for Red October actually happened, and Boris Gindin lived through every minute of it. After decades of silence and fear, Gindin has finally come forward to tell the entire story of the mutiny aboard the FFG Storozhevoy, the real-life Red October. It was the fall of 1975, and the tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States were climbing. It seemed the two nations were headed for thermonuclear war, and it was that fear that caused most of the crewman of the FFG Storozhevoy to mutiny. Their goal was to send a message to the Soviet people that the Communist government was corrupt and major changes were needed. That message never reached a single person. Within hours the orders came from on high to destroy the Storozhevoy and its crew members. And this would have happened if it weren't for Gindin and few others whose heroism saved many lives. Now, with the help of USA Today bestselling author David Hagberg, Gindin relives every minute of that harrowing event. From the danger aboard the ship to the threats of death from the KGB to the fear that forced him to flee the Soviet Union for the United States, Mutiny reveals the real-life story behind The Hunt for Red October and offers an eye-opening look at the Soviet Union during the height of the Cold War.

Froelich, uma agente do Serviço Secreto, recebe um pedido bastante incomum: \"Quero contratá-lo para assassinar o vice-presidente dos Estados Unidos da América\". Mais nova chefe de segurança do vice-presidente eleito, ela quer que Reacher tente encontrar as falhas na defesa de sua equipe, testando sua eficácia contra um potencial ataque. Reacher é a pessoa certa para isso: tem a habilidade e a furtividade de um ex-policial do Exército, além de ser totalmente anônimo. Ela só não fala que, na verdade, a ameaça é real e a vida do vice-presidente de fato corre perigo.",

    "description": "Vem da Suécia um dos maiores êxitos no gênero de mistério dos últimos anos: a série Millennium - da qual este romance, Os homens que não amavam as mulheres, é o primeiro volume. Em 1966, Harriet Vanger, jovem herdeira de um império industrial, some sem deixar vestígios. No dia de seu desaparecimento, fechara-se o acesso à ilha onde ela e diversos membros de sua extensa família se encontravam. Desde então, a cada ano, Henrik Vanger, o velho patriarca do clã, recebe uma flor emoldurada - o mesmo presente que Harriet lhe dava, até desaparecer. Ou ser morta. Pois Henrik está convencido de que ela foi assassinada. E que um Vanger a matou. Quase quarenta anos depois, o industrial contrata o jornalista Mikael Blomkvist para conduzir uma investigação particular. Mikael, que acabara de ser condenado por difamação contra o financista Wennerström, preocupa-se com a crise de credibilidade que atinge sua revista, a Millennium. Henrik lhe oferece proteção para a Millennium e provas contra Wennerström, se o jornalista consentir em investigar o assassinato de Harriet. Mikael descobre que suas inquirições não são bem-vindas pela família Vanger, e que muitos querem vê-lo pelas costas. De preferência, morto. Com o auxílio de Lisbeth Salander, que conta com uma mente infatigável para a busca de dados - de preferência, os mais sórdidos -, ele logo percebe que a trilha de segredos e perversidades do clã industrial recua até muito antes do desaparecimento ou morte de Harriet. E segue até muito depois.... até um momento presente, desconfortavelmente presente.",

Quer seja tratando da violência contra as mulheres, quer seja enfocando os crimes cometidos por magnatas ou pelo Estado, a saga cumpre sua principal missão: a de nos envolver numa leitura absorvente, cheia de mistérios. Neste terceiro volume da série, Lisbeth Salander se recupera, num hospital, de ferimentos que quase lhe tiraram a vida, enquanto Mikael Blomkvist procura conduzir uma investigação paralela que prove a inocência de sua amiga, acusada de vários crimes. Mas a jovem não fica parada, e muito mais do que uma chance para defender-se, ela quer uma oportunidade para dar o troco. E agora conta com excelentes aliados. Além de Mikael, jornalista investigativo que já desbaratou esquemas fraudulentos e solucionou crimes escabrosos, no mesmo front estão Annika Giannini, advogada especializada em defender mulheres vítimas de violência, e o inspetor Jan Bublanski, que segue sua própria linha investigativa, na contramão da promotoria. Com a ajuda deles, Lisbeth está muito perto de desmantelar um plano sórdido que durante anos se articulou nos subterrâneos do Estado sueco, um complô em cujo centro está um perigoso espião russo que ela já tentou matar. Duas vezes. A rainha do castelo de ar enfoca de modo original as mazelas da sociedade atual, tendo conquistado um lugar único dentro da literatura policial contemporânea.",

Uma muralha virtual impenetrável: é assim que se pode definir a rede da NSA, a temida agência de segurança americana. Quando a mensagem \"Você foi invadido\" piscou na tela de Ed Needham, responsável pelos computadores que guardam alguns dos maiores segredos do mundo, ele custou a acreditar. Que hacker seria capaz de algo assim? Para o leitor que acompanha a série Millennium, criada por Stieg Larsson, só há uma resposta possível: Lisbeth Salander está de volta. Mas por que Lisbeth, uma hacker fria e calculista que nunca dá um passo sem pesar as consequências, teria cometido um crime gravíssimo e provocado um dos maiores especialistas em segurança dos Estados Unidos? É o que se pergunta Mikael Blomkvist, principal repórter da explosiva revista Millennium, além de amigo e eventual amante de Lisbeth. Mas Blomkvist precisa lidar com seus próprios demônios: afundada numa crise sem precedentes, a revista foi comprada por um grupo que pretende modernizá-la. Nada mais repulsivo ao jornalista que prefere apurar e pesquisar suas histórias a ceder às demandas e ao ruído das redes sociais. Ainda assim, há tempos o repórter não emplaca um de seus furos, e por isso não hesita em sair no meio da madrugada para atender a um chamado que promete ser a grande história de sua carreira. Presos a uma teia de aranha mortífera, Lisbeth e Blomkvist terão mais uma vez que unir forças, agora contra uma perigosa conspiração internacional. Uma volta em grande estilo da dupla que mudou para sempre os romances de mistério e aventura.",

Now available in a single collection, the complete electrifying New York Times bestselling trilogy—Red Sparrow, Palace of Treason, and The Kremlin’s Candidate—“a primer in twenty-first-century spying...terrifically good” (The New York Times Book Review) from veteran CIA officer Jason Matthews. In present-day Russia, ruled by President Vladimir Putin, Russian intelligence officer Dominika Egorov struggles to survive in the post-Soviet intelligence jungle. Forced to become a “Sparrow”—a spy trained in the art of seduction to elicit information from unsuspecting marks—she’s been assigned to Nathaniel Nash, a CIA officer who handles the organization’s most sensitive Russian intelligence. The action in The Red Sparrow Trilogy careens between Russia, France, Hong Kong, Turkey, Greece, Italy, and the United States as these two young intelligence officers, trained in their respective spy schools, collide in a charged atmosphere of deception and a forbidden spiral of carnal attraction that threatens both their careers and consumes intelligence agencies from Moscow to the highest offices in the US government. In each book they confront not only the shadows and intrigues of the Russian and American intelligence networks but highly trained, cold-blooded killers assigned to destroy them. With a plot ripped from tomorrow’s headlines, and written with sophisticated brio, The Red Sparrow Trilogy has been hailed as a monumental accomplishment “as suspenseful and cinematic as the best spy movies” (The Philadelphia Inquirer); “fans of the genre’s masters including John le Carré and Ian Fleming will happily embrace Matthews’s central spy” (USA TODAY). Collected together, the three novels form a stunning masterwork of suspense, intrigue, sex, and violence.",

Tolkien's beloved classic—just in time for the December 2012 release of Peter Jackson's new film adaptation, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit is one of the best-loved fantasy books of all time and the enchanting \"prequel\" to The Lord of the Rings. With the help of some of history's great philosophers, this book ponders a host of deep questions raised in this timeless tale, such as: Are adventures simply \"nasty, disturbing, uncomfortable things\" that \"make you late for dinner,\" or are they exciting and potentially life-changing events? What duties do friends have to one another? Should mercy be extended even to those who deserve to die? Gives you new insights into The Hobbit's central characters, including Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf, Gollum, and Thorin and their exploits, from the Shire through Mirkwood to the Lonely Mountain Explores key questions about The Hobbit's story and themes, including: Was the Arkenstone really Bilbo's to give? How should Smaug's treasure have been distributed? Did Thorin leave his \"beautiful golden harp\" at Bag-End when he headed out into the Wild? (If so, how much could we get for that on eBay?) Draws on the insights of some of the world's deepest thinkers, from Confucius, Plato, and Aristotle to Immanuel Kant, William Blake, and contemporary American philosopher Thomas Nagel From the happy halls of Elrond's Last Homely House to Gollum's \"slimy island of rock,\" this is a must read for longtime Tolkien fans as well as those discovering Bilbo Baggins and his adventures \"there and back again\" for the first time.",

    "description": "Esta é a história de como um Baggins viveu uma aventura e deu por si a fazer e a dizer coisas totalmente inesperadas... Bilbo Baggins goza de uma vida confortável, calma e pouco ambiciosa. Raramente viaja mais longe do que a despensa ou a adega do seu buraco de hobbit, em Fundo-do-Saco. Mas a sua tranquilidade é perturbada quando, um dia, o feiticeiro Gandalf e uma companhia de treze anões aparecem à sua porta, para o levar numa perigosa aventura. Eles têm um plano: saquear o tesouro guardado por Smaug, O Magnífico, um dragão enorme e muito perigoso... Bilbo, embora relutante, junta-se a esta missão, desconhecendo que nesta viagem até à Montanha Solitária vai encontrar um anel mágico e uma estranha criatura conhecida como Gollum. Situado no mundo imaginário da Terra Média, O Hobbit, o prelúdio de O Senhor dos Anéis, vendeu milhões de exemplares em todo o mundo desde a sua publicação em 1937, impondo-se como um clássico intemporal e um dos livros mais adorados e influentes do século xx.",

    "description": "Treasure Island is an adventure novel by Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson, narrating a tale of \"buccaneers and buried gold\". Stevenson conceived of the idea of Treasure Island (originally titled, \"The Sea Cook: A Story for Boys\") from a map of an imaginary, romantic island idly drawn by Stevenson and his stepson on a rainy day in Braemar, Scotland. Plot: An old sailor, calling himself \"the captain\" comes to lodge at the Admiral Benbow Inn on the west English coast during the mid-1700s, paying the innkeeper's son, Jim Hawkins, a few pennies to keep a lookout for a one-legged \"seafaring man.\" A seaman with intact legs shows up, frightening Billy — who drinks far too much rum — into a stroke, and Billy tells Jim that his former shipmates covet the contents of his sea chest. After a visit from yet another man, Billy has another stroke and dies; Jim and his mother (his father has also died just a few days before) unlock the sea chest, finding some money, a journal, and a map. The local physician, Dr. Livesey, deduces that the map is of an island where a deceased pirate — Captain Flint — buried a vast treasure. The district squire, Trelawney, proposes buying a ship and going after the treasure, taking Livesey as ship's doctor and Jim as cabin boy.... Robert Louis Stevenson (1850 - 1894) was a Scottish novelist, poet, essayist, and travel writer. His most famous works are Treasure Island, Kidnapped, and Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. A literary celebrity during his lifetime, Stevenson now ranks among the 26 most translated authors in the world.",

    "description": "Think of the high seas and of a buccaneer ship; of a wild seaman with a sea chest full of gold; of Long John Silver; of a buried treasure and of young Jim Hawkins, the boy with the treasure map the key to it all. This is the Treasure Island and if you don't think of all this, the pirates will hunt you down and when they find you, for find you they sure will, they will truss you and carry you back to their ship and just before they feed you to the sharks, as you walk the gangplank with a sword digging sharp and sure into your back, they will sing their one last song for you. Robert Louis Stevenson’s Treasure Island was not the first adventure story of pirates in the Caribbean, but it may as well have been. Since its publication in 1883, it has become the standard—the first and last word on the subject—and it remains an exhilarating, satisfying read for young and old alike to this day. This edition includes all 16 of N.C. Wyeth’s full-color paintings for the 1911 edition of the book, as well as 44 drawings by Louis Rhead for his 1915 edition. Included as an addendum at the end of the book is the essay, “My First Book: Treasure Island” by Robert Louis Stevenson on the writing of his classic. Also included are a helpful glossary of nautical and historical terms, an introduction, author bio, and bibliography. The story begins when a strange, crusty old pirate comes to stay with Jim Hawkins’ family at the Admiral Benbow Inn. The map he carries with him will put them all in danger and be the impetus for young Jim’s perilous journey with the wily Long John Silver in search of treasure on the high seas.",

D'Artagnan is not one of the musketeers of the title; those are his friends Athos, Porthos and Aramis, inseparable friends who live by the motto \"all for one, one for all\", a motto which is first put forth by d'Artagnan. In 1625 France, d'Artagnan—a poor young nobleman—leaves his family in Gascony and travels to Paris with the intention of joining the Musketeers of the Guard. However, en route, at an inn in Meung-sur-Loire, an older man derides d'Artagnan's horse and, feeling insulted, d'Artagnan demands to fight a duel with him. The older man's companions beat d'Artagnan unconscious with a pot and a metal tong that breaks his sword. His letter of introduction to Monsieur de Tréville, the commander of the Musketeers, is stolen. D'Artagnan resolves to avenge himself upon the man, who is later revealed to be the Comte de Rochefort, an agent of Cardinal Richelieu, who is in Meung to pass orders from the Cardinal to Milady de Winter, another of his agents.",

    "description": "Torn between his duty and his desires, D’Artagnan must decide where his loyalties lie. Continuing \"The Three Musketeers\" adventures, this third volume reveals Milady’s true identity. It sets her on course for a showdown with D’Artagnan, who is still in love with her. And also brings to light a violent chapter from one of the other musketeers’ past. Meanwhile, France’s religious conflicts head towards a culmination—the siege of the city of La Rochelle. The Musketeers must prepare themselves for war. Deepening the bonds between our heroes, this is yet another boisterous adventure from the pen of Alexandre Dumas. Alexandre Dumas (1802 - 1870) was a hugely popular 19th century French writer. Born of mixed French and Haitian heritage, Dumas first rose to prominence in Paris as a playwright, but later gained international fame with his historical fiction. Often co-authored with other writers, these stories wove together swashbuckling adventure, romance, and real events from France’s past. Among the best known are \"The Three Musketeers\", and its sequels \"Twenty Years After\", and \"Le Vicomte de Bragelonne: Ten Years Later\". Set across four decades, this trilogy follows the rise of the dashing D’Artagnan—from hot-headed soldier to trusted captain under Louis XIV. Dumas’ other novels include \"The Count of Monte Cristo\" and \"The Black Tulip\". His works have been adapted into more than 200 movies, including The Man in the Iron Mask starring Leonardo DiCaprio.",

The only survivors from the wreck are a sixteen-year-old boy named Pi, a hyena, a zebra with a broken leg, a female orang-utan - and a 450-pound Royal Bengal tiger. Since it was first published in 2002, Life of Pi has entered mainstream consciousness and remains one of the most extraordinary works of fiction in recent years. In October 2005 Canongate launched a competition with The Times to find an artist to illustrate Yann Martel's international bestseller. Soon the competition expanded as the Globe and Mail and The Age newspapers also launched a search in Canada and Australia. From thousands of entries, Croatian artist Tomislav Torjanac was chosen as the illustrator for this new edition of Life of Pi. Now readers can enjoy this extraordinary tale with his glorious colour illustrations.",

This engaging summary presents an analysis of Life of Pi by Yann Martel, a powerful novel about the stories we tell ourselves and others and the nature of belief.

However, their ship is capsized by a storm, causing the deaths of everyone on board except Pi, who escapes on a lifeboat with a number of animals. Most of the animals quickly kill and eat each other, except Richard Parker, a Bengal tiger. Pi forms a tentative alliance with Richard Parker, and together they manage to overcome the many perils of the ocean and make their way back to shore – assuming, that is, that Pi’s account of his adventures is truthful.

    "description": "Life of Pi - A Comprehensive Summary Though it raises complex philosophical and religious questions, Life of Pi's plot is almost ridiculously easy to summarize: dude gets stuck on a lifeboat in the middle of the Pacific Ocean with a tiger, thinks about God. Done! Okay, maybe that's a little too simplistic. So we'll take you through the main events in a tad more detail—but remember much of the novel happens through digression and in Pi's meditations sprinkled throughout the novel. The book doesn't begin with Pi, but with an \"Author's Note.\" We learn how the \"author\" (who shares some of Yann Martel's biography) found Pi's story. We should note one point of complexity: the author admits any mistakes in the narrative are due to him and not Pi, since he's presumably put together Pi's story from interviews, notes, and Pi's diary. What we read, then, in Part 1 and Part 2 is Pi's voice as the author has written it. And then, without further ado, we launch into Pi's story. Here is a Preview of What You Will Get: ⁃ A Detailed Introduction ⁃ A Comprehensive Chapter by Chapter Summary ⁃ Etc Get a copy of this summary and learn about the book.",

When Pi is sixteen, his family emigrates from India to North America aboard a Japanese cargo ship, along with their zoo animals bound for new homes. The ship sinks. Pi finds himself alone in a lifeboat, his only companions a hyena, an orangutan, a wounded zebra, and Richard Parker, a 450-pound Bengal tiger. Soon the tiger has dispatched all but Pi, whose fear, knowledge, and cunning allow him to coexist with Richard Parker for 227 days while lost at sea. When they finally reach the coast of Mexico, Richard Parker flees to the jungle, never to be seen again. The Japanese authorities who interrogate Pi refuse to believe his story and press him to tell them \"the truth.\" After hours of coercion, Pi tells a second story, a story much less fantastical, much more conventional--but is it more true?",

The message sends Lindenbrock and Axel on a journey to Snæfellsjökull, Iceland, in search of an extinct volcano and a secret crater that they believe leads to the center of the earth. With with their guide, Hans Bjelke, they make a daring dive into the crater. The three travelers encounter all kinds of dangers and strange phenomena-from an underground world populated with fossils of prehistoric mammals and gigantic mushrooms to prehistoric fish and giant marine reptiles from the age of dinosaurs. Journey to the Center of the Earth is a dazzling display of science fiction adventure writing. Includes a detailed biographical note on the author's life.Jules Verne (1828-1905) was a French novelist, playwright, and poet who is best known for his enduring tales of adventure and discovery that include Journey to the Center of the Earth, Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea, and Around the World in Eighty Days. Verne's books about a variety of innovations and technological advancements-including the submarine, space travel, terrestrial flight and deep-sea exploration-years before they were practical realities, laid much of the foundation of modern science fiction. One of the most prolific, famous French novelists of all time, Verne has been the second most-translated author in the world since 1979, ranking between Agatha Christie and William Shakespeare.",

Ele passa a viver sozinho numa ilha deserta onde deve usar toda sua inteligência e coragem para lutar pela sua sobrevivência. Será que algum dia ele conseguirá sair dessa ilha? Além da bravura desse herói, essa obra trata de temas mais profundos como a lucidez, a solidão e a importância do contato social para o homem. Esse romance foi adaptado no filme de animação homônimo de Vincent Kesteloot, produzido em 2016. Tradução e adaptação de Monteiro Lobato. Daniel Defoe (1660-1731) foi um escritor e jornalista inglês considerado precursor do romance realista inglês. Membro de uma família dissidente da Igreja Anglicana, ele tentou preparar-se para seguir a carreira eclesiástica, mas acabou desistindo da carreira religiosa. Decidiu se estabelecer como comerciante e viajou muito pela Europa com diversos empreendimentos comerciais, mas não obteve muito êxito nesta área. Atraído pela política, ele escreveu numerosos panfletos. O seu romance \"Robinson Crusoé\" rendeu-lhe fama e notoriedade. Essa obra-prima foi adaptada diversas vezes, destacando-se o filme homônimo produzido em 1997, estrelando Pierce Brosnan, e a série de televisão \"Crusoe\" (2008-2009) produzida pela FOX.",

    "description": "\"The Life and Adventures of Robinson Crusoe\" by Daniel Defoe is a timeless classic that has captivated readers for centuries. This remarkable novel tells the gripping story of Robinson Crusoe, a young Englishman who finds himself stranded on a remote island after a shipwreck. Defoe's vivid prose plunges readers into the depths of Crusoe's solitary existence, as he must fend for himself and navigate the challenges of survival in a harsh and unforgiving environment. The novel showcases Crusoe's resourcefulness and resilience as he overcomes various obstacles, including building shelter, finding food, and taming wild animals. As the years pass, Crusoe transforms the island into a self-sufficient world, displaying an unwavering commitment to his own survival. Yet, amidst this tale of survival, there are deeper themes at play. The novel explores the profound resilience of the human spirit and the complexities of loneliness and isolation. Crusoe's introspective journey also raises questions about the nature of faith, providence, and our place in the world. What sets \"The Life and Adventures of Robinson Crusoe\" apart is its remarkable narrative style. Written in the form of Crusoe's diary, the novel creates an intimate and immersive reading experience that allows readers to intimately connect with the protagonist's thoughts and emotions. Defoe's attention to detail and his ability to vividly describe the island's scenery and Crusoe's daily rituals make this novel a compelling literary masterpiece. Beyond its immediate narrative, Defoe's novel serves as a reflection on society and the relationship between the individual and the collective. Crusoe's isolation forces him to confront existential questions, leading readers to ponder the limitations and potential of human beings when stripped of societal constraints. \"The Life and Adventures of Robinson Crusoe\" is a must-read for all literature enthusiasts. It combines adventure, exploration, and philosophical depth to create a truly unforgettable reading experience. Defoe's masterful storytelling and the enduring appeal of Crusoe's tale make this book a classic that continues to engage and inspire readers of all ages.",

After staging a dramatic escape he sets out to discover the fabulous treasure of Monte Cristo and catch up with his enemies.

    "description": "Thrown in prison for a crime he has not committed, Edmond Dantès is confined to the grim fortress of If. There he learns of a great hoard of treasure hidden on the Isle of Monte Cristo and he becomes determined not only to escape, but also to unearth the treasure and use it to plot the destruction of the three men responsible for his incarceration. Dumas’ epic tale of suffering and retribution, inspired by a real-life case of wrongful imprisonment, was a huge popular success when it was first serialized in the 1840s. While in prison, Dantès befriends an older prisoner who educates him and reveals the location of a vast treasure on the island of Monte Cristo. After a daring escape, Dantès acquires the treasure and transforms himself into the wealthy and enigmatic Count of Monte Cristo. He then embarks on a quest for vengeance against those who betrayed him, using his newfound wealth and influence to manipulate their lives. The novel is renowned for its intricate plot, rich character development, and themes of justice, revenge, and redemption. It explores the moral consequences of seeking revenge and the complexities of human nature. \"The Count of Monte Cristo\" has been adapted into numerous films, television series, and stage productions, cementing its status as one of the most enduring and beloved works of literature.",

Na natureza selvagem, de Jon Krakauer, autor do best-seller No ar rarefeito, traz uma história real. O corpo em decomposição de um jovem é encontrado no Alasca. A polícia descobre que se trata de um rapaz de família rica do Leste americano que largou tudo, se internou sozinho na aridez gelada e morreu de inanição. Quem era o garoto? Por que foi para o Alasca? Por que morreu? Para responder a essas e outras perguntas, Jon Krakauer refaz a trajetória de Chris McCandless, revelando a América dos que vivem à margem, pegando carona ou circulando em carros velhos, vivendo em acampamentos e cidades-fantasmas. Mergulha no mundo da cidadezinha rural, onde homens rudes bebem e conversam sobre o tempo e a colheita. Compara a história do jovem com a de outros aventureiros solitários que tiveram fim trágico. O resultado é uma narrativa envolvente, por vezes amarga, em que os sonhos da juventude se transformam em pesadelo.",

    "description": "LA VERITÀ MAI RACCONTATA SU CHRIS MCCANDLESS NEL LIBRO-RIVELAZIONE DELLA SORELLA DEL DISCUSSO PROTAGONISTA DI «INTO THE WILD». Nel 1993 Jon Krakauer pubblicò un articolo sulla rivista «Outside», intitolato «Death of an Innocent» (Morte di un innocente). Le parole di Krakauer sul giovane Chris McCandless che aveva trovato la morte in Alaska, dopo aver abbandonato la famiglia e aver vissuto per mesi senza soldi, viaggiando da solo nella wilderness, sollevarono un polverone. Chi considerò Chris un sognatore, chi un pazzo, chi un illuso, chi un idealista, chi un ribelle. Krakauer decise allora di trasformare l’articolo in un libro, «Nelle terre estreme», che ebbe un successo straordinario e che ispirò Sean Penn nel film «Into the Wild». Chris McCandless è suo malgrado diventato un mito: rappresenta la giovinezza che non ha paura di perdere tutto pur di seguire i suoi sogni. Ma Chris è anche un ragazzo in carne e ossa, con una famiglia che ha abbandonato. E le ragioni della sua scelta sono quelle che Krakauer aveva cercato di comprendere con l’aiuto della sorella di Chris, Carine. Ma Carine aveva chiesto a Krakauer di rispettare il silenzio su alcuni aspetti della vita del fratello che coinvolgevano i genitori e lei stessa. Tuttavia, a più di vent’anni dalla morte di Chris, Carine ha deciso che è ora di raccontare anche quella parte di verità che era rimasta in ombra. E racconta la storia della propria famiglia, di un padre violento, bigamo e, al tempo stesso, religiosissimo, di una madre sottomessa e insieme complice, spiegando perché la scelta di Chris «è stata la cosa più sensata che potesse fare». Un libro coraggioso, lucido, sensibile, la descrizione di una famiglia devastata e devastante, la storia di un ragazzo che si conferma una persona straordinaria...",

Para expressar o seu amor, além de tudo o que vive e sente, ele decide escrever um blog, \"porque escrever [...] é a única maneira que encontrou para fazer com que os outros o escutem\". Lá, ele pode falar livremente sobre a garota de sorriso encantador que encontrou na biblioteca da escola, quando ia devolver O amor nos tempos do cólera, sua leitura de férias de que tanto gostou. Assim começa a trama de O amor nos tempos do blog, um romance que se constrói de blog em blog, em que, depois de muitos desencontros, três histórias se cruzam, culminando em um final surpreendente. Além do blog de Ariza, há também o da Deusa Cibernética, uma garota que, segundo sua própria descrição, é divina, divertida e popular, gosta de frequentar o shopping com as amigas e está sempre de olho no menino mais gato do momento, e o de Cinderela Virtual, \"uma adolescente que acredita no amor\", não liga para a aparência e espera encontrar o seu príncipe encantado. É a linguagem rápida e dinâmica da internet que une os três personagens desta história e vai aos poucos revelando semelhanças e ligações inesperadas entre estes três adolescentes aparentemente tão diferentes, com características muitas vezes opostas e particularidades que se revelarão só ao fim da narrativa.",

    "description": "Design IT Organizations for Agility at Scale Aspiring digital businesses need overall IT agility, not just development team agility. In Agile IT Organization Design, IT management consultant and ThoughtWorks veteran Sriram Narayan shows how to infuse agility throughout your organization. Drawing on more than fifteen years’ experience working with enterprise clients in IT-intensive industries, he introduces an agile approach to “Business–IT Effectiveness” that is as practical as it is valuable. The author shows how structural, political, operational, and cultural facets of organization design influence overall IT agility—and how you can promote better collaboration across diverse functions, from sales and marketing to product development, and engineering to IT operations. Through real examples, he helps you evaluate and improve organization designs that enhance autonomy, mastery, and purpose: the key ingredients for a highly motivated workforce. You’ll find “close range” coverage of team design, accountability, alignment, project finance, tooling, metrics, organizational norms, communication, and culture. For each, you’ll gain a deeper understanding of where your organization stands, and clear direction for making improvements. Ready to optimize the performance of your IT organization or digital business? Here are practical solutions for the long term, and for right now. Govern for value over predictability Organize for responsiveness, not lowest cost Clarify accountability for outcomes and for decisions along the way Strengthen the alignment of autonomous teams Move beyond project teams to capability teams Break down tool-induced silos Choose financial practices that are free of harmful side effects Create and retain great teams despite today’s “talent crunch” Reform metrics to promote (not prevent) agility Evolve culture through improvements to structure, practices, and leadership—and careful, deliberate interventions",

Detective Finn Wight has been working Gerald’s case from the beginning. He refuses to drop it now, even though it is out of his jurisdiction. He keeps Jemima apprised of all his findings, no matter how painful. Defending her ‘innocent’ clients fills Jemima’s days. Finn’s muscular frame and easy smile fills her fantasies. But nothing relieves the guilt. Guilt that she couldn’t prevent Gerald’s devolution from genius scientist, to absent-minded professor, to ‘bat-shit crazy’ at the hands of paranoid schizophrenia. Guilt that, not long after his death, she was finding solace, and happiness, in the arms of another man. Feeding homeless in a local park helps ease Jemima’s pain. When a new ‘resident’ shows up, the others are wary. Though he refuses to speak, something in his eyes tells Jemima that he doesn’t belong there — that someone is looking for him. Jemima and Finn join forces to discover the man’s identity. They uncover the secret that sent him running from home, but there is so much that even he doesn’t know. Will the truth send him over the edge for good? Or can Jemima bring him back to reality? Bring him home? Before it is too late.",

When Germany invaded the Soviet Union during World War II, the Red Army began recruiting local partisans to help mount a resistance. This edition of The Partisan’s Companion is the last and best Red Army manual used to train these men to fight Nazi invaders. Besides field craft, it covers partisan tactics, German counter-guerrilla tactics, demolitions, German and Soviet weapons, scouting, camouflage, anti-tank warfare, and antiaircraft defense for squad and platoon-level instruction. It contains the Soviet lessons of two bitter years of war and provides a good look at the tactics and training of a mature partisan force. While this handbook was a vital part of Soviet victory over the Nazis, its usefulness outlived the Second World War. It was later used to train guerrilla groups in the developing world during their wars of national liberation in the 1950s–70s. Even the fedayeen guerrillas who fought US and coalition forces in Iraq relied on this manual for training, tactics, and general approach to combat. A selection of the Military Book Club.",

Jenkins spares no one in his search for the culprits who have taken the fun out of sports: NFL owners and refs, PGA Tour administrators, basketball players who can’t read, tennis players who can’t speak English (or say anything worth hearing when they do). He also finds things worth celebrating: the electric charge given off by Arnold Palmer at his best, the excitement of a truly great college football game, or a real heavyweight champion, like Joe Louis.

As the off-season caretaker at the atmospheric old hotel, he’ll have plenty of time to spend reconnecting with his family and working on his writing.

    "description": "Stanley Kubrick hailed The Shining as 'the scariest horror film of all time' before its release in 1980. Though the film opened to poor reviews, it has since become one of the most admired horror films in cinema history. Exerting an enormous influence on popular culture, The Shining has spawned a vast array of interpretations and conspiracy theories. Roger Luckhurst's illuminating study explores the film's themes, tropes and resonances through a detailed analysis of sequences and performances. Situating The Shining in a series of fresh contexts, Luckhurst looks at the complex nature of horror cinema at the end of the 1970s and early 80s. Taking the maze of the haunted hotel as a key motif, he offers numerous threads with which to navigate the strange twists and turns of this enigmatic film. This limited edition features original cover artwork by Mark Swan.",

Neste romance epistolar – construído a partir de cartas, diários e telegramas –, o advogado Jonathan Harker viaja até a Transilvânia para tratar de negócios com um conde sinistro e elegante. Em pouco tempo, Harker e seus companheiros percebem que estão em uma cilada empreendida por Drácula, essa terrível criatura que encarcera e seduz suas vítimas para depois lhes sugar o sangue. A história do vampiro mais célebre e aterrorizante do mundo ainda hoje ganha novas adaptações para cinema, quadrinhos, teatro e dança. Aqui em versão integral, o romance original do escritor irlandês inspira-se tanto na história de Vlad Tepes, sanguinário príncipe da Romênia que viveu no século XV, quanto em lendas sobre esse personagem e sobre vampiros.",

Embora o famoso conde não tenha sido o primeiro vampiro literário, certamente é o mais popular, sugado e adaptado para inúmeros universos: teatro, cinema, quadrinhos, séries e brinquedos, o semblante é reconhecido até mesmo por aqueles que nunca leram o romance. Ele está em todos os lugares.A obra atemporal de Bram Stoker narra, por meio de fragmentos de cartas, diários e notícias de jornal, a história de humanos lutando para sobreviver às investidas do vampiro Drácula. O grupo formado por Jonathan Harker, Mina Harker, dr. Van Helsing e dr. Seward tenta impedir que a vil criatura se alimente de sangue humano na Londres da época vitoriana, no final do século XIX.Um clássico absoluto do terror, Bram Stoker define em Drácula a forma como nós entendemos e pensamos os vampiros atualmente. Mais que isso, ele traz esse monstro para o centro do palco da cultura pop do nosso século e eterniza o vilão de modos refinados e comportamento sanguinário.DUAS EDIÇÕES PARA UM ROMANCE ÚNICONão é de agora que os leitores clamam por uma edição de Drácula feita pela DarkSide® Books para honrar o legado do mestre Bram Stoker. Uma obra tão grandiosa quanto essa será publicada em duas versões, para nenhum vampiro colocar defeito: FIRST EDITION, com a icônica capa amarela da primeira publicação, em 1897, uma edição inédita no mercado brasileiro que eterniza o brilho e o encanto do sol, algo inalcançável diante de toda a dor da eternidade; e a DARK EDITION, dedicada aos leitores trevosos de coração sombrio. Por dentro elas carregam o mesmo conteúdo sangrento; por fora demonstram a vida e a beleza de um clássico imortal.Para fazer os leitores se arrepiarem, Marcia Heloisa assina a tradução e introdução de Drácula. E como sangue tem poder, o descendente direto do autor, Dacre Stoker, escreve a preciosa apresentação desta edição.Carlos Primati e Marcia Heloisa dão suas contribuições para a perpétua criatura. O leitor encontra textos de apoio que contam as relações entre a verdadeira Transilvânia e a aquela eternizada no livro, bem como a influência dos vampiros na cultura pop mundial. E como a DarkSide® Books sabe o que faz o coração dos vivos leitores da editora bater mais forte, apresenta também o conto “O Hóspede de Drácula”, que fazia parte do texto de Stoker, mas foi retirado da primeira publicação.Todo esse conteúdo, planejado especialmente para os darksiders que sabem que existe uma razão para as coisas serem como são, é ornamentado com as belas e poderosas imagens de Samuel Casal, premiado quadrinista e ilustrador brasileiro, que fez uma releitura deslumbrante de personagens imortais.A coleção Medo Clássico da DarkSide® se consolida a cada mestre que entra em sua casa, fazendo uma homenagem aos grandes nomes da literatura que já causaram pesadelos inenarráveis aos leitores, década após década.

Did Dracula originate in a nightmare? What do we know of the relationship between Stoker and his wife? Did Stoker die of syphilis? How did Count Dracula become a vampire? Does Count Dracula have any redeeming qualities? How was the novel Dracula received when published in 1897? What did Stoker himself say about the novel? Why did Stoker name his vampire \"Dracula\"? Why did he select Transylvania as the vampire's homeland? How much did Stoker really know about Vlad the Impaler? Was Vlad ever associated with vampire legends? What are our main sources of information about Vlad? Why do many Romanians consider Vlad to be a national hero? Which of the Dracula movies is the best adaptation of Stoker's novel? What impact has Dracula had on subsequent vampire fiction? Why does Count Dracula have such enduring appeal? How do Romanians feel about Dracula tourism in their country? Is there a real Castle Dracula? What are some of the interpretations of Dracula? Is Dracula a classic? And many, many more!

Despite warnings from his hotelier, the Englishman leaves the safety of his carriage and wanders towards an abandoned “unholy” village.

    "description": "PREPARADOS PARA LIDAR COM AS CONSEQUÊNCIAS DE SUA ARRISCADA CRIAÇÃO. FRANKENSTEIN é um clássico do romantismo inglês do século XIX que retrata, entre outros aspectos, a vida do cientista Victor Frankenstein, ávido por descobrir os segredos da vida e da morte. Considerada a primeira obra de ficção científica da literatura, faz sucesso arrebatador desde o lançamento em 1818. A ideia nasceu durante o verão de 1816, quando Mary Shelley e seu marido hospedaram-se na mansão de Lord Byron, que os desafiou a criarem uma história de fantasma. Shelly então deu vida àquela que se tornaria um mito popular inigualável. A primeira edição foi publicada anonimamente – as editoras não acreditavam que uma menina tão jovem pudesse escrever daquela maneira. Posteriormente, o livro foi revisado e republicado em 1831, em edição que contava com introdução da autora e considerada a versão definitiva. E é essa a versão que a Editora Pandorga traz para seus leitores nesta edição luxuosa, com prefácio assinado por Shelley, com ilustrações e muitas curiosidades.",

    "description": "Mary Shelley (1797-1851) nasceu em Londres. Filha do filósofo William Godwin e da escritora Mary Wollstonecraft, e casada com o poeta Percy Bysshe Shelley, ela sempre esteve ligada à literatura. Sua indiscutível obra-prima é Frankenstein (1818), escrita a partir de uma brincadeira proposta por Lorde Byron. O subtítulo do romance, O Prometeu Moderno, torna clara a ligação com a mitologia grega, mas é evidente que Frankenstein é um romance que olha para a frente, tanto quanto para o passado. Na obra, o cientista e filósofo suíço Frankenstein é inspirado pela filosofia ocultista a criar uma figura de aspecto humano, infundindo-lhe vida. A partir dai, desenvolve-se a trama que agarra o leitor até o final. Frankenstein é um romance que aborda preocupações de um ponto da história no qual os desdobramentos só podiam ser imaginados. Mas permanece, sob todos os aspectos, uma parte inevitável da cultura que examina e prevê, e por essas razões precisa continuar sendo lido e reavaliado. Uma prosa fluida, imagística grotesca e imaginação surreal assegurarão que continue sendo desfrutado pelos seus leitores. Frankenstein, o Prometeu Moderno faz parte da famosa coletânea: 1001 livros para ler antes de morrer.",

Depois disso, esse conceito se torna uma obsessão para o jovem cientista. Recheado de referências literárias como Bysshe Shelley, Godwin, Lord Byron, e Mary Shelley. A caderneta de Victor Frankenstein é certo para se tornar um clássico do século XXI.",

É também um ensaio sobre a prepotência humana e a solidão em sociedade. Cego em seu propósito de dar vida à matéria inanimada, o cientista Victor Frankenstein constrói um ser monstruoso a partir de restos humanos - mas, quando enfim alcança o resultado pretendido, foge de sua própria criação! Abandonada e fadada ao desterro e à rejeição, a criatura passa a perseguir o cientista e, depois, a buscar vingança. Escrito por uma jovem Mary Shelley, o romance atravessou dois séculos sem perder a capacidade de arrepiar o leitor. Tendo por base a edição revista pela autora em 1831, consagrada como a definitiva, Frankenstein: edição comentada vem reforçar o time de sucessos da coleção Clássicos Zahar. Com tradução, apresentação e notas do escritor Santiago Nazarian, que flerta com o suspense e o terror psicológico, o livro traz também cronologia de vida e obra de Mary Shelley. E, nos anexos, a introdução da autora para a edição de 1831 e o prefácio do poeta inglês e seu marido Percy Bysshe Shelley para a primeira edição, publicada anonimamente em 1818. A versão impressa apresenta ainda capa dura e acabamento de luxo.",

    "description": "Nesse cássico do gênero terror, os mortos podem até voltar... mas não voltam iguais. Um dos mais aclamados de Stephen King, O cemitério é o livro que inspirou os filmes Cemitério Maldito, de 1989 e de 2019. Às vezes, a morte é melhor. Esse é o conselho que chega aos ouvidos de Louis Creed, um jovem médico que se muda para uma pequena cidade do Maine. Com sua nova casa, seu trabalho na universidade e sua família feliz, Louis acredita que finalmente encontrou seu lugar, e a finitude da vida é a última coisa a passar pela sua cabeça. Até que, caminhando pelo bosque da vizinhança, ele encontra um terreno onde gerações de crianças enterraram seus animais de estimação. Para além desses pequenos túmulos, há outro cemitério. Um que acabará se tornando irresistível, com suas forças sedutoras, capazes de tornar real o que sempre pareceu impossível. Uma premissa assustadora, uma narrativa tensa e um toque de drama e reflexão — essa é a mistura que fez de O cemitério um dos maiores cássicos do gênero. Ao mesmo tempo em que constrói uma narrativa aterrorizante, Stephen King levanta questões sobre a vida, a morte, o luto, o sobrenatural e os limites da intervenção humana. Em busca dessas respostas, o leitor é levado por uma trama impossível de largar, e quando descobre a verdade, percebe que ela é pior que a própria morte — e infinitamente mais poderosa. \"Outros livros podem até ser assustadores, mas O cemitério é terror de verdade.\" — The Guardian",

    "description": "Most scholarship on Mary Lambert's Pet Sematary (1989) overarchingly focuses on the Stephen King novel (1983), and tends strongly towards housing the story within the Gothic literary tradition. The film itself is often absent from considerations of North American horror cinema of the 1980s, and from wider horror scholarship in general. This Devil's Advocate stands as a corrective, and provides a holistic analysis – textual, contextual, and industrial – of the film, in order to properly situate it as an important entry into the history of horror cinema. This book joins a growing body of works – both journalistic and academic – that aim to revisit older films in order to call attention to and/or redress the gendered imbalance in our written horror histories. McMurdo charges Pet Sematary with several contributions to the horror genre: as an important entry within the tradition of “grief horror”; as a horror film that both adheres to and defies the generic conventions of its historical context, one both engaged with and respondent to its time of creation; as a film that changed the fortunes of the cinematic Stephen King “brand” on the cusp of a new decade. Pet Sematary is the highest grossing horror film directed by a woman in cinematic history, and it stands as a story that we keep returning to – as seen by the 1992 sequel, the 2019 remake, and a forthcoming prequel. Pet Sematary’s modern relevance and importance to genre history then, is manifold, and this book argues it is past time for its reconsideration as a classic of horror cinema.",

    "description": "The definitive, fascinating story of the scariest film ever made and its enduring impact in Hollywood and beyond—from the director’s biographer comes a must-read for horror fans and cinema buffs, just in time for the movie’s 50th anniversary and the release of the first movie in a new Exorcist trilogy. Includes a foreword by John Russo, author and cowriter of the seminal horror film Night of the Living Dead. On December 26, 1973, The Exorcist was released. Within days it had become legend. Moviegoers braved hours-long lines in winter weather to see it. Some audience members famously fainted or vomited. Half a century later, the movie that both inspired and transcends the modern horror genre has lost none of its power to terrify and unsettle. The Exorcist Legacy reveals the complete story of this cultural phenomenon, from the real-life exorcism in 1949 Maryland that inspired William Peter Blatty’s bestselling novel on which the movie is based, to its many sequels, prequels, TV series, and homages. Nat Segaloff, biographer of the film’s director, William Friedkin, draws on original interviews with cast, crew, and participants as well as revelations from personal papers to present an intriguing and surprising new view of the making of the movie, and its aftermath. Segaloff also examines as never before the keys to the movie’s enduring appeal. Friedkin and Blatty’s goal was far more ambitious than making a scary movie; they aimed to make people “think about the concept of good and evil.” The Exorcist succeeds, and then some, not just by creating on-screen scares, but by challenging viewers’ deepest personal beliefs—and fears.",

    "description": "That the synoptic writers believed that Jesus cast out demons and that such a role figured prominently in the Synoptics' portrait of him can scarcely be denied. And yet, only scant scholarly attention has been focused on Jesus' role as exorcist. Even less consideration has been given to the significance of Jesus as exorcist for understanding the historical Jesus. Now, in a provocative and insightful study, Graham Twelftree helps New Testament scholars move beyond such myopia. Twelftree examines exorcists and exorcism in first-century Palestine, assesses the New Testament accounts of demons and their demise, and explores the implications and significance of the fact that Jesus was indeed an exorcist. The volume appeared originally in the noted German series Wissenschaftliche Unteruchmungen zum Neuen Testament.",

    "description": "Originally published in 1971, The Exorcist is now a major television series on FOX. It remains one of the most controversial novels ever written and went on to become a literary phenomenon: It spent fifty-seven weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, seventeen consecutively at number one. Inspired by a true story of a child’s demonic possession in the 1940s, William Peter Blatty created an iconic novel that focuses on Regan, the eleven-year-old daughter of a movie actress residing in Washington, D.C. A small group of overwhelmed yet determined individuals must rescue Regan from her unspeakable fate, and the drama that ensues is gripping and unfailingly terrifying. Two years after its publication, The Exorcist was, of course, turned into a wildly popular motion picture, garnering ten Academy Award nominations. On opening day of the film, lines of the novel’s fans stretched around city blocks. In Chicago, frustrated moviegoers used a battering ram to gain entry through the double side doors of a theater. In Kansas City, police used tear gas to disperse an impatient crowd who tried to force their way into a cinema. The three major television networks carried footage of these events; CBS’s Walter Cronkite devoted almost ten minutes to the story. The Exorcist was, and is, more than just a novel and a film: it is a true landmark. Purposefully raw and profane, The Exorcist still has the extraordinary ability to disturb readers and cause them to forget that it is “ just a story.” Published here in this beautiful fortieth anniversary edition, it remains an unforgettable reading experience and will continue to shock and frighten a new generation of readers.",

    "description": "Netflix's The Haunting of Hill House has received both critical acclaim and heaps of contempt for its reimagining of Shirley Jackson's seminal horror novel. Some found Mike Flanagan's series inventive, respectful and terrifying. Others believed it denigrated and diminished its source material, with some even calling it a \"betrayal\" of Jackson. Though the novel has produced a great deal of scholarship, this is the first critical collection to look at the television series. Featuring all new essays from noted scholars and award-winning horror authors, this collection goes beyond comparing the novel and the Netflix adaptation to look at the series through the lenses of gender, architecture, education, hauntology, addiction, and trauma studies including analysis of the show in the context of 9/11 and #Me Too. Specific essays compare the series with other texts, from Flanagan's other films and other adaptations of Jackson's novel, to the television series Supernatural, Toni Morrison's Beloved and the 2018 film Hereditary. Together, this collection probes a terrifying television series about how scary reality can truly be, usually because of what it says about our lives in America today.",

It is the story of four seekers who arrive at a notoriously unfriendly pile called Hill House: Dr. Montague, an occult scholar looking for solid evidence of a “haunting”; Theodora, his lighthearted assistant; Eleanor, a friendless, fragile young woman well acquainted with poltergeists; and Luke, the future heir of Hill House. At first, their stay seems destined to be merely a spooky encounter with inexplicable phenomena. But Hill House is gathering its powers—and soon it will choose one of them to make its own.

All four of the inhabitants begin to experience strange events while in the house, including unseen noises and ghosts roaming the halls at night, strange writing on the walls and other unexplained events. Eleanor tends to experience phenomena to which the others are oblivious. At the same time, Eleanor may be losing touch with reality...A finalist for the National Book Award, The Haunting of Hill House is considered as one of the best literary ghost stories published during the 20th century, even by stalwarts like Stephen King. It has been made into two feature films, a TV series and a play. Jackson's novel relies on terror rather than horror to elicit emotion in the reader, utilizing complex relationships between the mysterious events in the house and the characters' psyches.

    "description": "Publicado originalmente em 1951, este segundo romance de Shirley Jackson é um thriller psicológico macabro que retrata como poucos o medo da solidão e da própria consciência. Natalie Waite tem dezessete anos e só pensa em sair logo da casa dos pais e entrar na universidade; ela sonha em ser livre. Seu pai é um escritor cheio de si, bastante dominador quando se trata de Natalie e sua mãe. Contudo, quando a menina finalmente consegue ir para a faculdade, as coisas não se desenrolam como o planejado e ela não encontra a felicidade que tanto desejava. Pouco a pouco, todas as certezas de Natalie evaporam, e ela não é mais capaz de compreender onde termina a realidade e onde começa sua sombria alucinação. Inspirado pelo desaparecimento de uma estudante universitária que vivia perto da casa de Shirley Jackson, O Homem da Forca conta uma história assombrosa e inquietante sobre loucura e obsessão. \"Shirley Jackson é mestre na arte da escrita envolvente.\" — Dorothy Parker \"Ler este livro é como entrar em um labirinto escuro apenas para descobrir que você já esteve nele, e que o romance apenas despertou algo que você tentou esquecer durante toda a sua vida.\" — The Rumpus",

    "description": "Hill House is a mansion in a location that is never specified but is between many hills. The story concerns four main characters: Dr. John Montague, an investigator of the supernatural; Eleanor Vance, a shy young woman who resents having lived as a recluse caring for her demanding disabled mother; Theodora, a bohemian artist implied to be a lesbian; and Luke Sanderson, the young heir to Hill House, who is host to the others. Dr. Montague hopes to find scientific evidence of the existence of the supernatural. He rents Hill House for a summer and invites as his guests several people whom he has chosen because of their experiences with paranormal events. Of these, only Eleanor and Theodora accept. Eleanor travels to the house, where she and Theodora will live in isolation with Montague and Luke. Hill House has two caretakers, Mr. and Mrs. Dudley, who refuse to stay near the house at night. The four overnight visitors begin to form friendships as Dr. Montague explains the building's history, which encompasses suicide and other violent deaths. All four of the inhabitants begin to experience strange events while in the house, including unseen noises and ghosts roaming the halls at night, strange writing on the walls, and other unexplained events. Eleanor tends to experience phenomena to which the others are oblivious. At the same time, Eleanor may be losing touch with reality, and the narrative implies that at least some of what Eleanor witnesses may be products of her imagination. Another implied possibility is that Eleanor possesses a subconscious telekinetic ability that is itself the cause of many of the disturbances experienced by her and other members of the investigative team (which might indicate there is no ghost in the house at all). This possibility is suggested especially by references early in the novel to Eleanor's childhood memories about episodes of a poltergeist-like entity that seemed to involve mainly her.",

Após a chegada desses forasteiros, fatos inexplicáveis vêm perturbar a rotina provinciana de Jerusalem`s Lot - uma criança é encontrada morta; habitantes começam a desaparecer sem deixar vestígios ou sucumbem a uma estranha doença. A morte passa a envolver a pequena cidade com seu toque maléfico e Ben e Mark são obrigados a escolher o único caminho que resta aos sobreviventes da praga - fugir. Mas isso não será tão simples, os destinos de Ben, Mark, Barlow e Jerusalem`s Lot estão agora para sempre interligados. E é chegada a hora do inevitável acerto de contas.",

    "description": "In a thoughtful, well-informed study exploring fiction from throughout Stephen King's immense oeuvre, Heidi Strengell shows how this popular writer enriches his unique brand of horror by building on the traditions of his literary heritage. Tapping into the wellsprings of the gothic to reveal contemporary phobias, King invokes the abnormal and repressed sexuality of the vampire, the hubris of Frankenstein, the split identity of the werewolf, the domestic melodrama of the ghost tale. Drawing on myths and fairy tales, he creates characters who, like the heroic Roland the Gunslinger and the villainous Randall Flagg, may either reinforce or subvert the reader's childlike faith in society. And in the manner of the naturalist tradition, he reinforces a tension between the free will of the individual and the daunting hand of fate. Ultimately, Strengell shows how King shatters our illusions of safety and control: \"King places his decent and basically good characters at the mercy of indifferent forces, survival depending on their moral strength and the responsibility they may take for their fellow men.\"",

The contributors examine how Bird Box provokes questions about a range of issues including the human body and its existence in the world, the ethical obligations that shape community, and the anxieties arising from technological development. Taken together, the essays of this volume show how a critical examination of Bird Box offers readers a guide for thinking through human experience in our own troubled, apocalyptic times.",

    "description": "Now a Netflix film starring Sandra Bullock, Trevante Rhodes, John Malkovich, Sarah Paulson, and Rosa Salazar! Written with the narrative tension of The Road and the exquisite terror of classic Stephen King, Bird Box is a propulsive, edge-of-your-seat horror thriller, set in an apocalyptic near-future world—a masterpiece of suspense from the brilliantly imaginative Josh Malerman. Something is out there . . . Something terrifying that must not be seen. One glimpse and a person is driven to deadly violence. No one knows what it is or where it came from. Five years after it began, a handful of scattered survivors remain, including Malorie and her two young children. Living in an abandoned house near the river, she has dreamed of fleeing to a place where they might be safe. Now, that the boy and girl are four, it is time to go. But the journey ahead will be terrifying: twenty miles downriver in a rowboat—blindfolded—with nothing to rely on but her wits and the children’s trained ears. One wrong choice and they will die. And something is following them. But is it man, animal, or monster? Engulfed in darkness, surrounded by sounds both familiar and frightening, Malorie embarks on a harrowing odyssey—a trip that takes her into an unseen world and back into the past, to the companions who once saved her. Under the guidance of the stalwart Tom, a motely group of strangers banded together against the unseen terror, creating order from the chaos. But when supplies ran low, they were forced to venture outside—and confront the ultimate question: in a world gone mad, who can really be trusted? Interweaving past and present, Josh Malerman’s breathtaking debut is a horrific and gripping snapshot of a world unraveled that will have you racing to the final page.",

She is locked away in a cellar room, but he can feel her presence by imagining he is a small bird visiting her through a hole he has made in a stone wall. He spends hours whistling a cardinal's song to her and she learns to whistle it back to him. She doesn't even know that Jakie exists, only the bird, but their communication is changing her. And the overwhelming, protective love that Jakie feels for the girl will compel himto find more of himself than he ever knew there was - and through this, he will alter their worlds profoundly. A remarkable exploration of the spirit, a sharp indictment of our blindness to what makes us human, and an unforgettable portrait of the power of the will,The Bird Box will move you in ways you never anticipated.",

Eles sabem que apenas um vislumbre das criaturas pode levar pessoas comuns a uma violência indescritível. Ainda não há explicação. Nenhuma solução. Tudo o que Malorie pode fazer é sobreviver... e transmitir aos filhos sua determinação. Não se descuidem, diz a eles. Fiquem vendados. E NÃO ABRAM OS OLHOS. Quando eles tomam conhecimento de uma notícia que parecia impossível, Malorie se permite ter esperança pela primeira vez desde o início do surto. Há sobreviventes. Pessoas que ela considerava mortas, mas que talvez estejam vivas. Junto dessa informação, porém, ela acaba descobrindo coisas aterrorizantes: em lugares não tão distantes, alguns afirmam ter capturado as criaturas e feito experimentos. Invenções monstruosas e ideias extremamente perigosas. Além disso, circulam rumores de que as próprias criaturas se transformaram em algo ainda mais assustador. Malorie agora precisa fazer uma escolha angustiante: viver de acordo com as regras de sobrevivência que funcionaram tão bem até então, ou se aventurar na escuridão e buscar a esperança mais uma vez.",

A serial murderer known only by a grotesquely apt nickname—Buffalo Bill—is stalking particular women. He has a purpose, but no one can fathom it, for the bodies are discovered in different states. Clarice Starling, a young trainee at the F.B.I. Academy, is surprised to be summoned by Jack Crawford, Chief of the Bureau's Behavioral Science section. Her assignment: to interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter, a brilliant psychiatrist and grisly killer now kept under close watch in the Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane. Lecter's insight into the minds of murderers could help track and capture Buffalo Bill. Smart and attractive, Starling is shaken to find herself in a strange, intense relationship with the acutely perceptive Lecter. His cryptic clues—about Buffalo Bill and about her—launch Clarice on a search that every reader will find startling, harrowing, and totally compelling.",

    "description": "The 1991 film 'The Silence of the Lambs', based on Thomas Harris's bestseller, was a game-changer in the fields of both horror and crime cinema. FBI trainee Clarice Starling was a new kind of heroine, vulnerable, intuitive, and in a deeply unhealthy relationship with her monstrous helper/opponent, the serial killer Hannibal Lecter. Jonathan Demme's film skillfully appropriated the tropes of police procedural, gothic melodrama and contemporary horror to produce something entirely new. The resulting film was both critically acclaimed and massively popular, and went on to have an enormous influence on 1990s genre cinema. This book closely examines the factors that contributed to the film's impact, including the revelatory performances of Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins in the lead roles.",

    "description": "Hannibal Lecter, um dos vilões mais icônicos de todos os tempos, surpreende gerações de leitores com sua inteligência e crueldade. Em Hannibal, sequência de O silêncio dos inocentes, acompanhamos a trajetória do personagem de Thomas Harris, agora perseguido por uma vítima do passado que busca vingança. Hannibal, terceiro livro com o personagem de sucesso mundial, acompanha Clarice Starling, agente do FBI que conseguiu deter o assassino Jame Gumb com a ajuda de Hannibal Lecter — um psicopata extremamente inteligente conhecido por devorar suas vítimas. Sete anos após a fuga de Lecter da prisão, Clarice vê sua carreira no FBI começar a desmoronar. Enquanto isso, Hannibal passa de caçador a caça quando começa a ser perseguido por um homem que sobreviveu a seu ataque. E é nesse jogo mortal que os caminhos de Clarice Starling e Hannibal Lecter se cruzam mais uma vez. Em 2001, a adaptação para o cinema de Hannibal, dirigida por Ridley Scott, modificou o fim da história, já que, segundo o diretor, o final original apresentado no livro era \"infilmável\". Um clássico aterrorizante e impactante para os leitores que gostam de se surpreender. \"Melhor do que O silêncio dos inocentes e O dragão vermelho.\" - Stephen King \"Completamente aterrorizante.\" - Los Angeles Times",

    "description": "Dragão vermelho é o livro em que Thomas Harris apresenta o vilão que se tornou mundialmente famoso, Hannibal Lecter. Em Dragão vermelho, o detetive Will Graham, que investiga uma série de assassinatos cometidos pelo criminoso Fada do Dente, precisará da ajuda do psiquiatra canibal para compreender a mente do assassino. Enquanto trabalhava como agente do FBI, Will Graham conseguiu reunir provas suficientes para condenar o canibal Hannibal Lecter. Depois do episódio, decidiu mudar-se para a Flórida com a família, mas seus dias de tranquilidade são interrompidos quando um ex-chefe lhe pede que investigue uma série de assassinatos misteriosos. Graham começa a seguir as pistas do cruel criminoso conhecido como Fada do Dente. Logo percebe que, para capturá-lo, precisará compreender a mente doentia do assassino. Para isso, entretanto, Graham terá de enfrentar os próprios fantasmas e pedir ajuda ao dr. Lecter, o que pode resultar em consequências desastrosas. Dragão vermelho ganhou uma adaptação para o cinema em 2002, dirigida por Brett Ratner e estrelada por Anthony Hopkins, Edward Norton e Ralph Fiennes.

Vinte cinco milhões de dólares em ouro estão escondidos em uma mansão em Miami Beach, e seu dono está morto. Há anos homens implacáveis têm tentado encontrar essa fortuna, e agora é a vez de Hans-Peter Schneider. Motivado pela ganância, ele ganha a vida com atividades ilícitas, e a principal delas é realizar as fantasias mais doentias de homens ricos em busca de mulheres... peculiares. Cari Mora, a caseira da mansão, é uma imigrante que fugiu da violência em seu país de origem. Ela vive em Miami, sempre com medo da sua situação com o Serviço de Imigração e Controle Alfandegário. Como seu visto para os Estados Unidos não é permanente, Cari não pode prosseguir com os estudos, por isso é obrigada a ter vários empregos para se sustentar. Uma bela mulher, marcada por cicatrizes da guerra, Cari atrai o olhar de Hans-Peter quando ele se aproxima do tão desejado tesouro. Mas ela tem habilidades surpreendentes, e essa não é a primeira vez que seu instinto de sobrevivência é posto à prova. Monstros vivem à espreita na fissura que existe entre o desejo dos homens e a sobrevivência das mulheres. E nenhum outro escritor foi capaz de criar monstros tão tenebrosos e brilhantes como Thomas Harris. Cari Mora, seu sexto romance, marca o retorno à escrita desse verdadeiro mestre da literatura.",

Yet today there is only one—homo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us? Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, Sapiens integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas. Dr. Harari also compels us to look ahead, because over the last few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us, but also ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we want to become? Featuring 27 photographs, 6 maps, and 25 illustrations/diagrams, this provocative and insightful work is sure to spark debate and is essential reading for aficionados of Jared Diamond, James Gleick, Matt Ridley, Robert Wright, and Sharon Moalem.",

A agricultura aumentou o nosso apetite. A mitologia manteve a lei e a ordem. O dinheiro deu-nos algo em que confiar. As contradições geraram a cultura. A ciência fez-nos letais. Recorrendo a ideias da paleontologia, antropologia e sociologia, Yuval Noah Harari analisa os principais saltos evolutivos da humanidade, desde as espécies humanas que coexistiam na Idade da Pedra até às revoluções tecnológicas e políticas do século XXI - que nos transformaram em deuses, capazes de criar e de destruir. Esta é uma obra desafiadora, desconcertante e inteligente, uma perspetiva única e original sobre a nossa História e o impacto do ser humano no planeta. Os elogios da crítica: «Interessante e estimulante, é um livro que nos dá uma perspetiva sobre o quão recente são a nossa presença na Terra e aspetos da vida humana como a agricultura e a ciência, e sobre por que razões devemos evitar dá-las como certas.» — Barack Obama «Sapiens é para a história da evolução humana o que Breve História do Tempo, de Stephen Hawking, representou para a física.» — Forbes",

They were insignificant animals whose ecological impact was less than that of fireflies or jellyfish. Today, there is only one human species left: Us. Homo sapiens. But we rule this planet. Sapiens, the book, takes us on a breath-taking ride through our entire human history, from its evolutionary roots to the age of capitalism and genetic engineering, to uncover why we are the way we are. Sapiens focuses on key processes that shaped humankind and the world around it, such as the advent or agriculture, the creation of money, the spread of religion and the rise of the nation state. Unlike other books of its kind, Sapiens takes a multi-disciplinary approach that bridges the gaps between history, biology, philosophy and economics in a way never done before. Furthermore, taking both the macro and micro view, Sapiens conveys not only what happened and why, but also how it felt for individuals. Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind is a book by Professor Yuval Noah Harari first published in Hebrew in Israel in 2011, and in English in 2014. Harari cites Jared Diamond’s Guns, Germs, and Steel (1997) as one of the greatest inspirations for the book by showing that it was possible to “ask very big questions and answer them scientifically”.

Today there is just one. Us. Homo Sapiens. How did our species succeed in the battle for dominance? Why did our foraging ancestors come together to create cities and kingdoms? How did we come to believe in gods, nations, and human rights; to trust money, books, and laws; and to be enslaved by bureaucracy, timetables, and consumerism? And what will our world be like in the millennia to come? In Sapiens, Dr. Yuval Noah Harari spans the whole of human history, from the very first humans to walk the earth to the radical — and sometimes devastating — breakthroughs of the Cognitive, Agricultural, and Scientific Revolutions. Drawing on insights from biology, anthropology, palaeontology, and economics, he explores how the currents of history have shaped our human societies, the animals and plants around us, and even our personalities. Have we become happier as history has unfolded? Can we ever free our behaviour from the heritage of our ancestors? And what, if anything, can we do to influence the course of the centuries to come? Bold, wide-ranging and provocative, Sapiens challenges everything we thought we knew about being human: our thoughts, our actions, our power...and our future.",

The Cognitive Revolution is one of the key turning points in human history that Harari examines in great detail.

How big cities and empires occurred, what made us believe in Gods, why did money arise? From that curious and interesting past, we are also presented with a projection into the future, towards the millenniums to come.It is a well narrated chronical of life. From the first humans that inhabited the earth, all the way to the considerable progress like the great cognitive, agricultural and scientific revolutions. This work has drawn interest from universities and the public.

    "description": "\"Fascinating.... Lays a foundation for understanding human history.\"—Bill Gates In this \"artful, informative, and delightful\" (William H. McNeill, New York Review of Books) book, Jared Diamond convincingly argues that geographical and environmental factors shaped the modern world. Societies that had had a head start in food production advanced beyond the hunter-gatherer stage, and then developed religion --as well as nasty germs and potent weapons of war --and adventured on sea and land to conquer and decimate preliterate cultures. A major advance in our understanding of human societies, Guns, Germs, and Steel chronicles the way that the modern world came to be and stunningly dismantles racially based theories of human history. Winner of the Pulitzer Prize, the Phi Beta Kappa Award in Science, the Rhone-Poulenc Prize, and the Commonwealth club of California's Gold Medal.",

    "description": "Edição comemorativa dos vinte anos de publicação. Armas, germes e aço procura demonstrar, por meio de uma intrigante revisão da evolução dos povos, que o destino dos europeus, nativos americanos, africanos, asiáticos e australianos foi moldado por fatores geográficos e ambientais, e não por questões étnicas ou particularidades referentes à inteligência e às aptidões de cada grupo. Através de uma viagem de 13 mil anos de história dos continentes, Jared Diamond conclui que a dominação de uma população sobre outra tem fundamentos militares (armas), tecnológicos (aço) ou nas doenças (germes), que dizimaram sociedades, asseguraram conquistas, proporcionaram a expansão dos domínios de determinados povos e, consequentemente, conferiu-lhes grande poder político e econômico.",

    "description": "PADA 1970-an, ketika sedang berada di Papua untuk meneliti burung, Jared Diamond ditanyai oleh sahabatnya yang orang Papua: Mengapa orang kulit putih membuat banyak barang berharga, sementara orang Papua tidak? Pertanyaan itu sebenarnya adalah pertanyaan mengenai mengapa kemajuan peradaban di berbagai benua itu berbeda-beda. Guns, Germs & Steel, buku pemenang Hadiah Pulitzer 1998, adalah jawaban Jared Diamond bagi pertanyaan sahabatnya. Mengapa sebagian bangsa di dunia bisa mencapai kemajuan teknologi dan peradaban, sehingga lantas menaklukkan dan menjajah bangsa di bagian dunia lain? Apakah itu karena bangsa-bangsa itu hakikatnya lebih unggul daripada lainnya? Atau semua bangsa sama saja, dan yang membedakan adalah faktor lingkungan berupa tanah, iklim, flora-fauna, dan sejarah alam? Guns, Germs & Steel mengajak kita melihat riwayat peradaban manusia pada masa tepat sebelum masa sejarah—mulai sekitar tahun 11000 SM—yang justru penting karena pada waktu itulah unsur-unsur pembentuk peradaban manusia seperti pertanian dan bahasa muncul. Dari situ kita diajak meninjau perkembangan di semua benua, dan mengetahui mengapa kemajuan peradaban manusia di berbagai tempat itu berbeda-beda.",

Crafted and edited with care, Worth Books set the standard for quality and give you the tools you need to be a well-informed reader. This short summary and analysis of Guns, Germs, and Steel by Jared Diamond includes: Historical context Chapter-by-chapter summaries Detailed timeline of key events Important quotes Fascinating trivia Glossary of terms Supporting material to enhance your understanding of the original work About Guns, Germs, and Steel by Jared Diamond: Professor Jared Diamond’s informative and fascinating Pulitzer Prize–winning Guns, Germs, and Steel explores a historic question: Why were the Eurasian peoples able to dominate those from other lands? Diamond argues that it was ecology and geography—not race—that shaped the modern world. Societies that developed in regions with fertile land for farming and that had domesticable plants and animals were able to progress more quickly, thereby creating the tools to conquer preliterate cultures. Drawing on a variety of disciplines—from linguistics, genetics, and epidemiology to biology, anthropology, and technology—Guns, Germs, and Steel offers an eloquently argued view of the development of human societies. The summary and analysis in this ebook are intended to complement your reading experience and bring you closer to a great work of nonfiction.",

He has revised his discussions of early humankind to account for the most recent findings; he presents a new view of the Jewish revolt against Rome led by Bar Kochba. In addition, his account of the end of the Roman Empire has been rewritten in light of the most recent thinking by classical historians.

This is the first volume in a bold series that tells the stories of all peoples, connecting historical events from Europe to the Middle East to the far coast of China, while still giving weight to the characteristics of each country. Susan Wise Bauer provides both sweeping scope and vivid attention to the individual lives that give flesh to abstract assertions about human history. Dozens of maps provide a clear geography of great events, while timelines give the reader an ongoing sense of the passage of years and cultural interconnection. This old-fashioned narrative history employs the methods of “history from beneath”—literature, epic traditions, private letters and accounts—to connect kings and leaders with the lives of those they ruled. The result is an engrossing tapestry of human behavior from which we may draw conclusions about the direction of world events and the causes behind them.",

    "description": "An Introduction to the Ancient World offers a thorough survey of the history of the ancient Near East, Greece and Rome. Covering the social, political, economic and cultural processes that have influenced later western and Near Eastern civilisations, this volume considers subjects such as the administrative structures, economies and religions of the ancient Near East, Athenian democracy, the development of classical Greek literature, the interaction of cultures in the Hellenistic world, the political and administrative system of the Roman Republic and empire, and the coming of Christianity, all within the broad outline of political history. This third edition is thoroughly updated and some chapters are completely rewritten to cover recent historical research. Changes include: more attention to economic structures and developments, and to the history of the later Roman Empire (third to sixth centuries AD); incorporation of the results of recent archaeological and historical research, and recently published studies of ancient literature; ‘boxes’ that support the main text, on topics including economic and political systems, religion and terminology; redrawn maps and new, higher-quality images; the inclusion of useful websites in the bibliography. An Introduction to the Ancient World provides an easily readable, user-friendly, integrated overview for students of ancient history, classics and archaeology. Lavishly illustrated, clearly and concisely written, and well organised, this fully updated and revised edition will remain a key resource for students beginning to investigate the civilisations of the ancient Mediterranean.",

Frankopan teaches us that to understand what is at stake for the cities and nations built on these intricate trade routes, we must first understand their astounding pasts. Frankopan realigns our understanding of the world, pointing us eastward. It was on the Silk Roads that East and West first encountered each other through trade and conquest, leading to the spread of ideas, cultures and religions. From the rise and fall of empires to the spread of Buddhism and the advent of Christianity and Islam, right up to the great wars of the twentieth century—this book shows how the fate of the West has always been inextricably linked to the East. Also available: The New Silk Roads, a timely exploration of the dramatic and profound changes our world is undergoing right now—as seen from the perspective of the rising powers of the East.",

    "description": "From the bestselling author of The Silk Roads comes an updated, timely, and visionary book about the dramatic and profound changes our world is undergoing right now—as seen from the perspective of the rising powers of the East. \"All roads used to lead to Rome. Today they lead to Beijing.\" So argues Peter Frankopan in this revelatory new book. In the age of Brexit and Trump, the West is buffeted by the tides of isolationism and fragmentation. Yet to the East, this is a moment of optimism as a new network of relationships takes shape along the ancient trade routes. In The New Silk Roads, Peter Frankopan takes us on an eye-opening journey through the region, from China's breathtaking infrastructure investments to the flood of trade deals among Central Asian republics to the growing rapprochement between Turkey and Russia. This important book asks us to put aside our preconceptions and see the world from a new—and ultimately hopeful—perspective.",

    "description": "The Silk Road is as iconic in world history as the Colossus of Rhodes or the Suez Canal. But what was it, exactly? It conjures up a hazy image of a caravan of camels laden with silk on a dusty desert track, reaching from China to Rome. The reality was different--and far more interesting--as revealed in this new history. In The Silk Road, Valerie Hansen describes the remarkable archeological finds that revolutionize our understanding of these trade routes. For centuries, key records remained hidden--sometimes deliberately buried by bureaucrats for safe keeping. But the sands of the Taklamakan Desert have revealed fascinating material, sometimes preserved by illiterate locals who recycled official documents to make insoles for shoes or garments for the dead. Hansen explores seven oases along the road, from Xi'an to Samarkand, where merchants, envoys, pilgrims, and travelers mixed in cosmopolitan communities, tolerant of religions from Buddhism to Zoroastrianism. There was no single, continuous road, but a chain of markets that traded between east and west. China and the Roman Empire had very little direct trade. China's main partners were the peoples of modern-day Iran, whose tombs in China reveal much about their Zoroastrian beliefs. Silk was not the most important good on the road; paper, invented in China before Julius Caesar was born, had a bigger impact in Europe, while metals, spices, and glass were just as important as silk. Perhaps most significant of all was the road's transmission of ideas, technologies, and artistic motifs. The Silk Road is a fascinating story of archeological discovery, cultural transmission, and the intricate chains across Central Asia and China.",

Foi naquela região, composta pelos continentes europeu e asiático, que surgiram os grandes impérios da antiguidade e as grandes religiões de alcance universal. Lá se desenvolveram as maiores batalhas da história: das cruzadas às conquistas de Alexandre; da guerra da Crimeia às duas guerras mundiais. É nessa região que, por mais de cem anos, está sendo travada a grande guerra pelo petróleo que sangra o Oriente Médio. Dominar este coração do mundo era o sonho de Hitler – e de tantos outros conquistadores. Em um livro original e provocativo, Peter Frankopan propõe uma nova visão da história, revela relações inesperadas entre os eventos do passado e nos encoraja e ver os acontecimentos do presente com um olhar diferente.",

The world is changing dramatically and in an age of Brexit and Trump, the themes of isolation and fragmentation permeating the western world stand in sharp contrast to events along the Silk Roads, where ties have been strengthened and mutual cooperation established. Following the Silk Roads eastwards from Europe through to China, by way of Russia and the Middle East, The New Silk Roads provides a timely reminder that we live in a world that is profoundly interconnected. In this prescient contemporary history, Peter Frankopan assesses the global reverberations of these continual shifts in the centre of power – all too often absent from headlines in the west. This important – and ultimately hopeful – book asks us to reread who we are and where we are in the world, illuminating the themes on which all our lives and livelihoods depend. The Silk Roads, a major reassessment of world history, has sold over 1 million copies worldwide.",

    "description": "The ancient trade routes that made up the Silk Road were some of the great conduits of cultural and material exchange in world history. In this intriguing book, Xinru Liu reveals both why and how this long-distance trade in luxury goods emerged in the late third century BCE, following its story through to the Mongol conquest. Liu starts with China's desperate need for what the Chinese called \"the heavenly horses\" of Central Asia, and describes how the traders who brought these horses also brought other exotic products, some all the way from the Mediterranean. Likewise, the Roman Empire, as a result of its imperial ambition as well as the desire of its citizens for Chinese silk, responded with easterly explorations for trade. The book shows how the middle men, the Kushan Empire, spread Buddhism to China. Missionaries and pilgrims facilitated cave temples along the mountainous routes and monasteries in various oases and urban centers, forming the backbone of the Silk Road. The author also explains how Islamic and Mongol conquerors in turn controlled the various routes until the rise of sea travel diminished their importance.",

Traversing snowy mountain passes, vast, forbidding deserts and stormy seas, these ancient trade routes were about much more than the movement of goods, they paved the way for an unprecedented period of cultural exchange, diplomacy and conflict creating a legacy that continues to affect global geopolitics in the 21st century. Forged over millennia through a desire for enterprise, the Silk Roads have had an profound influence on Eurasia and beyond, connecting cultures, languages, customs and religions. And with China now working to reopen this ancient trade network, the time is right to shine a new light on its history and impact. This edition has been updated with an expanded chapter on China's efforts to reopen this ancient trade network through the Belt and Road Initiative and the many impacts it has had along the way, from its ambitious infrastructure projects to new cities emerging along its route to the growth of a digital silk road, Geordie Torr examines the profound impacts of the revival of the world's greatest trading route. With helpful timelines and useful information boxes, The Silk Roads gives you everything you need to master the history of this world-changing region.",

Raras vezes essa história foi contada de forma tão deliciosa.\" Library Journal A cultura dos Estados Unidos é tão presente entre nós, brasileiros, e somos tão influenciados pela história desse país que surpreende a escassez de fontes bibliográficas que apresentem ao leitor comum a trajetória estado-unidense de forma acessível. Uma breve história dos Estados Unidos vem preencher esta lacuna, relatando, de forma fascinante e com um estilo saboroso, os principais episódios e desafios dos últimos quinhentos anos, desde os primórdios, na época do descobrimento da América por Cristóvão Colombo e da predominância dos povos nativos, até a era atual. Porém, muito mais do que apenas listar os principais fatos desse período, Davidson humaniza a história, mostrando como vidas individuais e acontecimentos se cruzam para tecer a trama do que chamamos de grande história. Em capítulos curtos e instigantes, organizados em ordem cronológica, o livro dá vida a centenas de indivíduos – célebres e desconhecidos – que simbolizam momentos e questões norte-americanas cruciais: William Bradford (líder de um dos primeiros grupos de peregrinos a chegar no Novo Mundo), o destemido chefe sioux Touro Sentado; George Washington, Thomas Jefferson e Abraham Lincoln; Henry David Thoreau, Walt Whitman, Martin Luther King, a abolicionista Harriet Tubman, a sufragista Jane Addams, entre muitos outros nomes. O que emerge dessa variada trama é uma nação dinâmica, frequentemente aguerrida, incomumente inovadora e rica em contradições, das quais tira grande parte de sua força; uma nação cujo fascínio, enfim, jamais cessa de se reinventar.",

    "description": "Adapted from the bestselling grassroots history of the United States, the story of America in the world, told in comics form Since its landmark publication in 1980, A People's History of the United States has had six new editions, sold more than 1.7 million copies, become required classroom reading throughout the country, and been turned into an acclaimed play. More than a successful book, A People's History triggered a revolution in the way history is told, displacing the official versions with their emphasis on great men in high places to chronicle events as they were lived, from the bottom up. Now Howard Zinn, historian Paul Buhle, and cartoonist Mike Konopacki have collaborated to retell, in vibrant comics form, a most immediate and relevant chapter of A People's History: the centuries-long story of America's actions in the world. Narrated by Zinn, this version opens with the events of 9/11 and then jumps back to explore the cycles of U.S. expansionism from Wounded Knee to Iraq, stopping along the way at World War I, Central America, Vietnam, and the Iranian revolution. The book also follows the story of Zinn, the son of poor Jewish immigrants, from his childhood in the Brooklyn slums to his role as one of America's leading historians. Shifting from world-shattering events to one family's small revolutions, A People's History of American Empire presents the classic ground-level history of America in a dazzling new form.",

Since its publication in 1947, it has been read by tens of millions of people all over the world. It remains a beloved and deeply admired testament to the indestructible nature of the human spirit. Restored in this Definitive Edition are diary entries that were omitted from the original edition. These passages, which constitute 30 percent more material, reinforce the fact that Anne was first and foremost a teenage girl, not a remote and flawless symbol. She fretted about and tried to cope with her own sexuality. Like many young girls, she often found herself in disagreements with her mother. And like any teenager, she veered between the carefree nature of a child and the full-fledged sorrow of an adult. Anne emerges more human, more vulnerable and more vital than ever. Anne Frank and her family, fleeing the horrors of Nazi occupation, hid in the back of an Amsterdam warehouse for two years. She was thirteen when she went into the Secret Annex with her family.

Quase um século depois, no sótão da casa de Buddy Elias, primo de Anne Frank, em Basileia, foi encontrado um maço com mais de mil cartas, documentos e fotos – que dão ainda maior significado para a história da família e, ao mesmo tempo, colocam em evidência os relatos da própria Anne. Narrada pela esposa de Buddy, Gerti Elias, e pela renomada Mirjam Pressler, A história da família de Anne Frank tece um retrato envolvente e cativante de uma das mais famosas famílias judaicas vitimadas pelas atrocidades da Segunda Guerra Mundial. Sentimentos e convicções multiplicam-se desde a primeira página, com a descrição das férias na casa dos Frank em Sils Maria, Alpes Suíços, no verão de 1935, onde a família, cujos membros viviam espalhados pelo continente europeu, reunia-se anualmente.",

Não é por acaso que seus poemas são conhecidos de cor por tantos brasileiros e que suas frases enriquecem as agendas de tantos jovens. A popularidade e a universalidade deste gaúcho nascem exatamente da simplicidade com que ele consegue dizer, em poucos traços, verdades tão íntimas. Mario Quintana é um dos poetas mais populares do Brasil e seus poemas circulam não só nas agendas, cadernos de estudantes e salas de aula, mas em epígrafes, redes sociais, programas de rádio e TV. Quintana explorou inúmeros gêneros poéticos, como sonetos, canções, quadras, poemas livres, poemas em prosa, aforismos, porém sem nunca se vincular a modismos, movimentos ou estéticas literárias. Singular em sua lírica, aponta para o que há de mais sublime no cotidiano; vivencia outros universos, repletos de fantasia e liberdade, à margem de convenções, revelando a essência das coisas mais simples.",

Nem animais domésticos, nem silvestres; nem peixes, nem aves; nem mesmo insetos de qualquer espécie perturbam a monotonia da vida dos aldeões. Mas dois garotos, Mati e sua amiga Maia, não se conformam com os rodeios e as histórias mal contadas dos adultos e resolvem investigar por conta própria, desafiando a proibição de entrar no bosque, onde reina o temível Nehi, o demônio das montanhas. Depois dessa aventura, nenhum dos dois será mais o mesmo - nem a aldeia. Numa linguagem desenvolta, plena de humor e sutileza, Oz nos envolve num universo assombroso e fascinante, exaltando o poder do conhecimento, da independência de espírito e da ética pessoal contra as idéias feitas que perpetuam a discriminação, a intolerância, a opressão. Não há, portanto, solução de continuidade entre a empenhada literatura \"adulta\" do escritor e esta que ele definiu apropriadamente como \"uma fábula para todas as idades\".",

    "description": "On December 17, 1903, in a fragile little plane which they had built at home for less than $1,000, Wilbur and Orville Wright made the first powered flights in the history of mankind—and opened the Air Age. Why did these two brothers, mechanics by trade, succeed where trained scientists—working with unlimited funds and the backing of great institutions—had repeatedly failed? In this biography, authorized by Orville Wright and first published in 1943, Fred Kelly separates fact from legend and recreates the dramatic achievements of two men, self-taught inventors, who solved the “impossible” problem of flight. The Wright Brothers is a story of total adventure—the sharp physical adventure of flight in perilously frail machines, and the breathtaking intellectual adventure of minds discovering through tireless research and sudden, brilliant hunches the solution to the “impossible” problem of flight. Fred Kelly is recognized as one of the world’s foremost authorities on the Wright brothers—their growth, their struggles, their disappointments and their ultimate triumph. For more than thirty years he was a personal friend of Orville Wright and talked with him daily while writing this book. The result is a vivid recreation of the birth and pioneer days of aviation and an intimate, affectionate portrait of two men whose inventive genius changed the world. “A gripping book on a fascinating subject...”—Boston Globe",

Long considered the definitive Wright biography (the manuscript was read and approved by Orville Wright), this book recounts the Wrights' small-town boyhood, their early interest in all things mechanical, the establishment of the Wright Cycle Shop, and the complete behind-the-scenes story of how they designed, built, tested, and flew (December 1903) the first \"Flyer.\" Enhanced with sixteen rare photographs, Mr. Kelly's engaging account avoids minute technical description, yet describes simply and clearly the technological innovations that enabled the two brothers to succeed where so many others had failed. Anyone interested in the mechanics of flight or early aviation will find this volume a splendid introduction to the Wright brothers and their epochal achievement.",

    "description": "One of the most influential books of the past fifty years, Team of Rivals is Pulitzer Prize–winning author and esteemed presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin’s modern classic about the political genius of Abraham Lincoln, his unlikely presidency, and his cabinet of former political foes. Winner of the prestigious Lincoln Prize and the inspiration for the Oscar Award winning–film Lincoln, starring Daniel Day-Lewis, directed by Steven Spielberg, and written by Tony Kushner. On May 18, 1860, William H. Seward, Salmon P. Chase, Edward Bates, and Abraham Lincoln waited in their hometowns for the results from the Republican National Convention in Chicago. When Lincoln emerged as the victor, his rivals were dismayed and angry. Throughout the turbulent 1850s, each had energetically sought the presidency as the conflict over slavery was leading inexorably to secession and civil war. That Lincoln succeeded, Goodwin demonstrates, was the result of a character that had been forged by experiences that raised him above his more privileged and accomplished rivals. He won because he possessed an extraordinary ability to put himself in the place of other men, to experience what they were feeling, to understand their motives and desires. It was this capacity that enabled Lincoln as president to bring his disgruntled opponents together, create the most unusual cabinet in history, and marshal their talents to the task of preserving the Union and winning the war. We view the long, horrifying struggle from the vantage of the White House as Lincoln copes with incompetent generals, hostile congressmen, and his raucous cabinet. He overcomes these obstacles by winning the respect of his former competitors, and in the case of Seward, finds a loyal and crucial friend to see him through. This brilliant multiple biography is centered on Lincoln's mastery of men and how it shaped the most significant presidency in the nation's history.",

Além de tudo isso, aos vinte anos ela é a única sobrevivente de um massacre terrível, para o qual a polícia ainda não encontrou qualquer explicação. Alguns podem dizer que Alex jogou sua vida fora.

When the Third Reich fell, it fell swiftly. The Nazis had little time to destroy their memos, their letters, or their diaries. William L. Shirer’s sweeping account of the Third Reich uses these unique sources, combined with his experience living in Germany as an international correspondent throughout the war. The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich earned Shirer a National Book Award and continues to be recognized as one of the most important and authoritative books about the Third Reich and Nazi Germany ever written. The diaries of propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, as well as evidence and other testimony gained at the Nuremberg Trials, could not have found more artful hands. Shirer gives a clear, detailed, and well-documented account of how it was that Adolf Hitler almost succeeded in conquering the world. With millions of copies in print, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich is a chilling and illuminating portrait of mankind’s darkest hours. “A monumental work.” —Theodore H. White",

    "description": "A concise and timely account of Hitler’s—and fascism’s—rise to power and ultimate defeat, from one of America’s most famous journalists. American journalist and author William L. Shirer was a correspondent for six years in Nazi Germany—and had a front-row seat to Hitler’s mounting influence. His most definitive work on the subject, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, is a riveting account defined by first-person experience interviewing Hitler, watching his impassioned speeches, and living in a country transformed by war and dictatorship. Shirer was originally commissioned to write The Rise and Fall of Adolf Hitler for a young adult audience. This account loses none of the immediacy of The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich—capturing Hitler’s ascendence from obscurity, the horror of Nazi Germany’s mass killings, and the paranoia and insanity that marked the führer’s downfall. This book is by no means simplified—and is sure to appeal to adults as well as young people with an interest in World War II history. “For nearly 100 years William L Shirer has spoken to us of fascism, Nazis, and Hitler . . . [He] tells the unvarnished truth as he experienced it . . . I figured this school-type book wasn’t going to tell me anything new. But when I started reading, I realized that I wasn’t reading for the facts anymore. I listened to his story and heard the urgency in his voice: a voice from nearly 60 years ago telling us the truth about today.” —Daily Kos",

    "description": "The abuse of power, genocide, the destruction of total war, unimaginable cruelty and the suffering of millions were all central features of Hitler's Nazi regime. Yet the Nazis were also highly successful in manipulating images and information: they mobilized and engaged vast numbers of people, caught the imagination of the young and appeared remarkably modern to many contemporary observers. Was the Third Reich a throwback to a mythical past or a brutally modern and technologically advanced state? Was Hitler a strong dictator who achieved his clear goals, or was his chaotic style of government symptomatic of a weak dictator, unable to control the complex and contradictory forces that he had unleashed? Was the Third Reich ruled by terror, or largely supported by a compliant German population? Was the genocide against the Jews a peculiarly German phenomenon, or a uniquely German expression of a terrible wider trend? Whittock explores these and other key questions, interrogating the views of different historians and drawing on a wealth of primary sources - from state-sponsored art to diaries, letters and memoirs of both perpetrators and victims - to provide an overview of the complex evidence. History should aim to put us firmly in touch with the lives of people living in the past and the issues they faced. Whittock never loses sight of the individuals whose lives were caught up in these extraordinary events, while also giving a lucid overview of the bigger picture.",

    "description": "This carefully crafted ebook: \"THE HISTORY OF THE DECLINE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE (All 6 Volumes)\" is formatted for your eReader with a functional and detailed table of contents. The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire is a book of history which traces the trajectory of Western civilization (as well as the Islamic and Mongolian conquests) from the height of the Roman Empire to the fall of Byzantium. The work covers the history of the Roman Empire, Europe, and the Catholic Church from 98 to 1590 and discusses the decline of the Roman Empire in the East and West: I. The first period may be traced from the age of Trajan and the Antonines, when the Roman monarchy, having attained its full strength and maturity, began to verge towards its decline; and will extend to the subversion of the Western Empire, by the barbarians of Germany and Scythia, the rude ancestors of the most polished nations of modern Europe. This extraordinary revolution, which subjected Rome to the power of a Gothic conqueror, was completed about the beginning of the sixth century. II. The second period commences with the reign of Justinian, who, by his laws, as well as by his victories, restored a transient splendor to the Eastern Empire. It will comprehend the invasion of Italy by the Lombards; the conquest of the Asiatic and African provinces by the Arabs, who embraced the religion of Mahomet; the revolt of the Roman people against the feeble princes of Constantinople; and the elevation of Charlemagne, who, in the year eight hundred, established the second, or German Empire of the West III. The last and longest period includes about six centuries and a half; from the revival of the Western Empire, till the taking of Constantinople by the Turks, and the extinction of a degenerate race of princes. Edward Gibbon (1737-1794) was an English historian and Member of Parliament.",

Boorstin Illustrations by Giovanni Battista Piranesi Edward Gibbon's masterpiece, which narrates the history of the Roman Empire from the second century A.D. to its collapse in the west in the fifth century and in the east in the fifteenth century, is widely considered the greatest work of history ever written. This abridgment retains the full scope of the original, but in a breadth comparable to a novel. Casual readers now have access to the full sweep of Gibbon's narrative, while instructors and students have a volume that can be read in a single term. This unique edition emphasizes elements ignored in all other abridgments--in particular the role of religion in the empire and the rise of Islam.",

    "description": "The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire is Edward Gibbon's magnum opus, written and published over a 13-year period beginning in 1776. It not only chronicles the events of the downfall starting with the end of the rule of Marcus Aurelius, but proposes a theory as to why Rome collapsed: the populace, Gibbon theorizes, lost its moral fortitude, its militaristic will, and its sense of civic duty. History is considered a classic in world literature, and Gibbon is sometimes called the first \"modern historian\" for his insistence upon using primary sources for his research. Many scholars today still use his highly regarded work as reference. In this third of seven volumes, readers will find Chapter 25 (\"Reigns of Jovian and Valentinian, Division of the Empire\") through Chapter 35 (\"Invasion by Attila\"), which cover the rules of Jovian, Valentinian, Valens, Gratian, Theodosius, Arcadius, Honorius, Eutropius, and Valentinian III; wars in Germany, Britain, Africa, and Persia; the Gothic War in 376; the conversion of Rome; the revolt of the Goths; the numerous sackings of Rome by the Goths and Charles V; revolutions in Gaul and Spain; the life of Saint John Chrysostom; the life of Empress Eudocia; the progress of the Vandals in Africa; and the invasion of the Roman Empire by Attila the Hun. English parliamentarian and historian EDWARD GIBBON (1737-1794) attended Magdelan College, Oxford for 14 months before his father sent him to Lausanne, Switzerland, where he continued his education. He published Essai sur l'tude de la Littrature (1761) and other autobiographical works, including Mmoire Justificatif pour servir de Rponse l'Expos, etc. de la Cour de France (1779).",

That masterpiece is Thinking, Fast and Slow' Financial Times 'A lifetime's worth of wisdom' Steven D. Levitt, co-author of Freakonomics Why do we make the decisions we do? Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman, 'the world's most influential living psychologist' (Steven Pinker) revolutionised our understanding of human behaviour with Thinking, Fast and Slow. Distilling his life's work, Kahneman shows how there are two ways we make choices: fast, intuitive thinking, and slow, rational thinking. He reveals how our minds are tripped up by error, bias and prejudice (even when we think we are being logical) and gives practical techniques that enable us all to improve our decision-making. This profound exploration of the marvels and limitations of the human mind has had a lasting impact on how we see ourselves.

    "description": "Uma visão inovadora sobre como nossa mente funciona e como tomamos decisões. Daniel Kahneman, ganhador do Prêmio Nobel de Economia por pesquisas que colocam em xeque a ideia de que a nossa tomada de decisões é essencialmente racional, é um dos mais importantes pensadores do século XXI. Suas ideias tiveram um impacto profundo em muitas áreas, incluindo economia, psicologia, medicina e política, mas é a primeira vez que o autor reúne seus muitos anos de pesquisa e pensamento em um único livro. Rápido e devagar: duas formas de pensar apresenta uma visão tão inovadora quanto inquietante sobre como a mente funciona e como as decisões são tomadas. No livro, o autor explica as duas formas como se desenvolvem o pensamento humano: uma é rápida, intuitiva e emocional; a outra, mais lenta, deliberativa e lógica. Kahneman expõe as capacidades extraordinárias — e também os defeitos e vícios — do pensamento rápido e revela o peso das impressões intuitivas no processo de tomada de decisões. O autor revela quando é possível ou não confiar na intuição. Oferece insights práticos e esclarecedores sobre como são tomadas as decisões nos negócios e na vida pessoal, e como se pode usar diferentes técnicas para proteger contra falhas mentais que, muitas vezes, colocam o indivíduo em situações de apuro. Eleito um dos melhores livros de 2011 pelo New York Times Book Review",

    "description": "Richard H. Thaler dedicou a sua carreira ao estudo de uma noção que parece radical: os agentes centrais da Economia são os seres humanos, ou seja, pessoas previsíveis e propensas a erros. Mau Comportamento é, neste sentido, uma tentativa séria de recuperar uma disciplina académica que deve ter os pés assentes na terra para mudar o modo como pensamos acerca de Economia, de nós próprios e do mundo. A Economia tradicional é feita de intervenientes racionais. No início de sua carreira, porém, Thaler demonstrou que não agimos como se fôssemos seres de razão, uma vez que nos assemelhamos mais a uma espécie de autómatos quando fazemos coisas tão simples como comprar um relógio, vender bilhetes para um espetáculo ao qual não podemos assistir, efetuar uma hipoteca e tantas outras situações recorrentes. Por norma, sucumbimos aos preconceitos e tomamos decisões que se afastam da racionalidade e da razoabilidade. Por outras palavras, temos um mau comportamento e essa atuação desviante tem consequências graves. Reunindo descobertas recentes da Psicologia humana com uma compreensão prática de incentivos de mercado e de comportamento, Thaler ilumina os leitores relativamente à tomada de decisões mais inteligentes num mundo cada vez mais incompreensível. Assim, revela-nos como a análise económica comportamental abre novas formas de olharmos para o mundo em questões tão díspares como a vida doméstica, o modo como vemos televisão, abrimos um escritório novo, concebemos projetos pessoais ou profissionais e até como criamos negócios alternativos semelhantes à Uber.",

    "description": "Ao ler este resumo, o senhor saberá o que o autor entendeu das muitas experiências que teve com a maneira como pensamos e tomamos decisões. Ele realizou essas experiências com a ajuda de psicólogos e de economistas. O senhor também vai descobrir : que o resultado dessas análises tornou possível determinar dois sistemas de pensamento; que a intuição e a reflexão são duas funções distintas; que muitas vezes agimos sem pensar e que as decisões que tomamos \"sem pensar\" não são necessariamente más; que o otimismo inerente à natureza humana nos leva ao capitalismo; que a tomada de decisões envolve ambos os sistemas de pensamento. O objetivo deste livro é distinguir entre intuição e reflexão, as \"duas velocidades do pensamento\" que Daniel Kahneman chama de Sistema 1 (intuição) e Sistema 2 (reflexão). Sem chegar ao ponto de dizer que o homem tem dois cérebros, ele detalha, com a ajuda de suas experiências, as diferenças de capital dessas duas formas de pensar e mostra que esses dois sistemas podem às vezes estar em competição, mas também provam ser complementares. Daniel Kahneman especifica que a maior parte de suas pesquisas foi feita com Amos Tversky, um psicólogo israelense que desde então faleceu. Outros psicólogos chamam isso de \"Fast Thinking\" (intuição) e \"Slow Thinking\" (reflexão), mas o autor prefere chamar os dois sistemas porque seus processos são muito diferentes. São esses dois sistemas que serão analisados neste livro. Suas experiências não seguem necessariamente uma lógica de seqüência e não têm necessariamente ligações entre eles.",

How can you transform your thinking to help avoid overconfidence and become a better decision maker? Thinking, Fast and Slow ...in 30 Minutes is the essential guide to quickly understanding the fundamental components of decision making outlined in Daniel Kahneman's bestselling book, Thinking, Fast and Slow. Understand the key ideas behind Thinking, Fast and Slow in a fraction of the time: Concise chapter-by-chapter synopses Essential insights and takeaways highlighted Illustrative case studies demonstrate Kahneman's groundbreaking research in behavioral economics In Thinking, Fast and Slow, Daniel Kahneman, best-selling author and recipient of the Nobel Prize in Economics, has compiled his many years of groundbreaking research to offer practical knowledge and insights into how people's minds make decisions. Challenging the standard model of judgment, Kahneman aims to enhance the everyday language about thinking to more accurately discuss, diagnose, and reduce poor judgment. Thought, Kahneman explains, has two distinct systems: the fast and intuitive System 1, and the slow and effortful System 2. Intuitive decision making is often effective, but in Thinking, Fast and Slow Kahneman highlights situations in which it is unreliable-when decisions require predicting the future and assessing risks. Presenting a framework for how these two systems impact the mind, Thinking, Fast and Slow reveals the far-reaching impact of cognitive biases-from creating public policy to playing the stock market to increasing personal happiness-and provides tools for applying behavioral economics toward better decision making.

    "description": "Autor best-seller do The New York Times, Michael Lewis examina como uma teoria premiada com o Nobel de Economia alterou para sempre a nossa percepção da realidade. O projeto desfazer conta a envolvente história da parceria de dois psicólogos israelenses cujo trabalho deu origem ao livro Rápido e devagar: Duas formas de pensar e transbordou a psicologia, influenciando áreas como economia, medicina e gestão de negócios. Ambos tiveram carreiras importantes no meio universitário e no Exército de Israel, e suas pesquisas são profundamente conectadas às suas experiências pessoais. Amos Tversky era o centro das atenções em qualquer lugar que estivesse, um guerreiro extrovertido e autoconfiante. Já Danny Kahneman, um filho do Holocausto, é um fugitivo da guerra que se tornou um homem introvertido, inseguro, sempre se questionando em relação às suas próprias ideias. Michael Lewis conta esta parceria se tornou uma das mais importantes da história do meio científico, e esmiúça os métodos de trabalho da dupla. O entrosamento era tamanho que eles não conseguiam saber quem havia tido determinada ideia e quem deveria ter o crédito por ela. Invariavelmente, decidiam no cara e coroa quem seria o autor principal do trabalho e apenas alternavam a autoria do artigo seguinte. Ao contar a história desta amizade que transformou a nossa forma de pensar, Michael Lewis nos ajuda a entender a perigosa influência da memória e dos estereótipos nos nossos processos de avaliação. Além disso, nos mostra que confiar apenas no nosso instinto pode os levar à decisão errada e que a incerteza deve ser levada muito em conta quando estamos tomando decisões importantes. Assim, a história de Tversky e Kahneman nos dá lições de como fazer previsões, nos ajudando a tomar melhores decisões nas nossas vidas.",

Why do some people achieve so much more than others? Can they lie so far out of the ordinary? In this provocative and inspiring book, Malcolm Gladwell looks at everyone from rock stars to professional athletes, software billionaires to scientific geniuses, to show that the story of success is far more surprising, and far more fascinating, than we could ever have imagined. He reveals that it's as much about where we're from and what we do, as who we are - and that no one, not even a genius, ever makes it alone. Outliers will change the way you think about your own life story, and about what makes us all unique. 'Gladwell is not only a brilliant storyteller; he can see what those stories tell us, the lessons they contain' Guardian 'Malcolm Gladwell is a global phenomenon ... he has a genius for making everything he writes seem like an impossible adventure' Observer 'He is the best kind of writer - the kind who makes you feel like you're a genius, rather than he's a genius' The Times",

    "description": "362 SEMANAS NA LISTA DE MAIS VENDIDOS DO THE NEW YORK TIMES O que torna algumas pessoas capazes de atingir um sucesso tão extraordinário e peculiar a ponto de serem chamadas de \"fora de série\"? Costumamos acreditar que trajetórias excepcionais, como a dos gênios que revolucionam o mundo dos negócios, das artes, das ciências e dos esportes, devem-se unicamente ao talento. Mas neste livro você verá que o universo das personalidades brilhantes esconde uma lógica muito mais fascinante e complexa do que aparenta. Baseando-se na história de celebridades como Bill Gates, os Beatles e Mozart, Malcolm Gladwell mostra que ninguém \"se faz sozinho\". Todos os que se destacam por uma atuação fenomenal são, invariavelmente, pessoas que se beneficiaram de oportunidades incríveis, vantagens ocultas e heranças culturais. Tiveram a chance de aprender, trabalhar duro e interagir com o mundo de uma forma singular. Esses são os indivíduos fora de série – os outliers. Para Gladwell, mais importante do que entender como são essas pessoas é saber qual é sua cultura, a época em que nasceram, quem são seus amigos, sua família e o local de origem de seus antepassados, pois tudo isso exerce um impacto fundamental no padrão de qualidade das realizações humanas. E ele menciona a história de sua própria família como exemplo disso. Aqui você saberá também de que maneira os legados culturais explicam questões interessantes, como o espantoso domínio que os asiáticos têm da matemática e o fato de o número de acidentes aéreos ser significativamente mais alto nos países onde as pessoas se encontram a uma distância muito grande do poder.",

The self-made-man is a myth. So don't worry. If you're not a Nobel Prize winner, a famous lawyer, a professional basketball player, it's not your fault! You were probably born at the wrong time. Your parents may not be making clothes. You may not be of Asian descent. But you can be just as successful as Bill Gates, Mozart or Robert Oppenheimer in their day.

    "description": "\"O mundo se torna menos complicado com um livro de Malcolm Gladwell na mão.\" – The New York Times Há três mil anos, num campo de batalha na antiga Palestina, um jovem pastor derrubou um poderoso guerreiro com apenas uma pedra e uma funda, e desde então os nomes Davi e Golias simbolizaram as batalhas entre os mais fracos e os gigantes. A vitória de Davi foi improvável e milagrosa. Ele não deveria ter ganhado. Ou deveria? Em Davi e Golias, Malcolm Gladwell desafia nossas crenças sobre obstáculos e desvantagens, oferecendo uma interpretação nova do que significa ser discriminado, enfrentar uma deficiência, perder pai ou mãe, frequentar uma faculdade medíocre ou sofrer uma série de outros aparentes reveses. Gladwell começa pela história real do que ocorreu entre o gigante e o jovem pastor tantos anos atrás e prova como, de fato, era Davi o grande favorito. Em seguida, com sua habilidade característica para contar boas histórias e envolver o leitor, ele narra importantes acontecimentos na vida de anônimos e famosos, introduzindo conceitos que nos levam a ver o favoritismo com outros olhos. O autor examina o conflito religioso na Irlanda do Norte, a reação dos londrinos aos bombardeios alemães na Segunda Guerra, a mente de pesquisadores do câncer e líderes negros dos direitos civis, os assassinatos e o alto custo da vingança, e a dinâmica das salas de aula que obtêm bons e maus resultados – tudo isso com o intuito de demonstrar que muita coisa bela e importante no mundo surge do que pode ser visto inicialmente como sofrimento e adversidade. Na tradição dos sucessos anteriores de Gladwell, Davi e Golias lança mão da história, da psicologia e de uma narrativa poderosa para abalar e reformular nosso pensamento sobre o mundo à nossa volta.",

Você aprenderá a se comunicar com delicadeza e tato, a criar uma rede de contatos sólida, a projetar uma imagem positiva e a dominar as ferramentas digitais. Veja algumas maneiras de colocar isso em prática: • Mude a forma de usar as redes sociais. Evite apontar o dedo e fazer críticas e passe a incentivar e elogiar. O modo como você fala faz toda a diferença. • Pense duas vezes antes de dizer algo de que poderá se arrepender. Se você desenvolver o autocontrole, evitará perder horas tendo que se retratar. • Torne suas mensagens relevantes, retirando o que só favorece você mesmo, e evite falar mal das pessoas como estratégia para se diferenciar. • Acalme-se antes de se comunicar. Quando algo ruim acontece e deixa você desanimado ou irritado, os cinco primeiros minutos são os mais perigosos. • Tenha a diplomacia como critério padrão. Admita que pode estar errado e que o outro pode estar certo. Seja agradável. Faça perguntas. E, acima de tudo, considere a situação do ponto de vista do outro e demonstre respeito.",

Dale Carnegie confessava aos amigos que era o mais surpreendido autor do mundo - afinal, quando em 1936 publicou o livro Como Fazer Amigos e Influenciar Pessoas, nunca tinha imaginado que venderia mais de 15 milhões de exemplares. Rico e famoso, continuou a dar formação como sempre fizera. E ao longo das aulas apercebeu-se de que a maior parte dos seus alunos - sobretudo homens de negócios - tinham um problema: viviam constantemente preocupados. Disposto a ajudá-los, Dale Carnegie começou a investigar o tema. Leu tudo o que tinha sido publicado, mas não ficou satisfeito - afinal procurava um manual prático para dar aos alunos e não um tratado teórico. Decidiu então escrever ele próprio e começou a testá-lo junto dos alunos. Dava-lhes \"trabalhos de casa\", e depois incluía no livro apenas os mais eficazes. Como Deixar de Se Preocupar e Começar a Viver, publicado em 1948, tornou-se imediatamente um sucesso e viria a vender mais de 6 milhões de exemplares. Hoje permanece tão atual como há 65 anos. Se quer abraçar a vida, pare de se preocupar: este é o livro que o vai ajudar a alcançar o seu objetivo.",

Born into poverty on a farm in Missouri, he was the author of the bestselling How to Win Friends and Influence People (1936), How to Stop Worrying and Start Living (1948) and many more self-help books. Summary of the Book 1. The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it. “You can’t win an argument. You can’t because if you lost it, you lose it; and if you win it, you lose it,” because, “a man convinced against his will, is of the same opinion still”. Instead, try to: A. Welcome the disagreement – you might avoid a serious mistake. B. Watch out for and distrust your first instinct to be defensive. C. Control your temper. D. Listen first. E. Look first for areas of agreement. F. Be honest about and apologise for your mistakes. G. Promise to think over your opponent’s ideas and study them carefully. H. Thank the other person sincerely for their time and interest. I. Postpone action to give both sides time to think through the problem. 2. Show respect for the other person’s opinions. Never say “You’re wrong.” It’s “tantamount to saying: ‘I’m smarter than you are.'” Instead, consider that “you will never get into trouble by admitting that you may be wrong” and see the above point. Even if you know you are right, try something like: “I may be wrong. I frequently am. If I’m wrong I want to be put right. Let’s examine the facts.” ---------- Techniques in Handling",

NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY The Wall Street Journal • Financial Times In The Power of Habit, award-winning business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us to the thrilling edge of scientific discoveries that explain why habits exist and how they can be changed. Distilling vast amounts of information into engrossing narratives that take us from the boardrooms of Procter & Gamble to the sidelines of the NFL to the front lines of the civil rights movement, Duhigg presents a whole new understanding of human nature and its potential. At its core, The Power of Habit contains an exhilarating argument: The key to exercising regularly, losing weight, being more productive, and achieving success is understanding how habits work. As Duhigg shows, by harnessing this new science, we can transform our businesses, our communities, and our lives.

    "description": "There's never been a better time to set new habits. This book will change your life. In The Power of Habit, award-winning journalist Charles Duhigg takes us into the thrilling and surprising world of the scientific study of habits. He examines why some people and companies struggle to change, despite years of trying, while others seem to remake themselves overnight. He visits laboratories where neuroscientists explore how habits work and where, exactly, they reside in our brains. And he uncovers how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and civil-rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr. The result is a compelling argument and an empowering discovery: the key to exercising regularly, losing weight, raising exceptional children, becoming more productive or even building revolutionary companies is understanding how habits work. By harnessing this new science, we can transform our businesses, our communities, and our lives. ______________________________ '[An] essential manual for business and living.'

If habits are badly managed, it can lead to devastating results both in personal and business life.According to the author, there are case studies which show that people with unusual habits formed those habits thanks to the neurological mechanism in the human brain that forms habits, and human habit is actually the result of constantly repeating of one event. There are three parts to habit formation. These include the cue, which triggers a habit loop, which is a certain routine for execution, and feedback, or a reward, which then tells to brain that it needs to repeat certain events in order to achieve this reward and/or to get this feedback.Also, the author says that habits can be changed but that even though a habit can be changed, no habit can be erased completely.The Power of Habit is more than just a scientific work filled with scientific information. It is also a book that can help us to understand why there are habits in our lives, how they are created, whether they can be changed, and, if yes, how they can be changed. This book is practical literature with a practical approach to solving a problem.Here Is A Preview Of What You Will Get:- In The Power of Habit , you will get a summarized version of the book.- In The Power of Habit , you will find the book analyzed to further strengthen your knowledge.- In The Power of Habit , you will get some fun multiple choice quizzes, along with answers to help you learn about the book.Get a copy, and learn everything about The Power of Habit .",

    "description": "Em O poder do hábito, o vencedor do prêmio Pulitzer Charles Duhigg explica por que fazemos o que fazemos. Em Mais rápido e melhor, ele mostra como melhorar o que fazemos. Um grupo de cientistas de dados do Google embarca num estudo sobre como as melhores equipes funcionam e descobre que a forma que um grupo interage é mais importante do que quem está no grupo. Os diretores do filme Frozen, da Disney, estão quase sem prazo e à beira de uma catástrofe - até que decidem sacudir suas equipes da maneira certa e estimulam um avanço criativo que resultou em um dos filmes mais lucrativos de todos os tempos. O que essas pessoas têm em comum? Elas sabem que produtividade tem que ver com as escolhas que fazemos. Estudos recentes sugerem que a produtividade nem sempre está relacionada a trabalhar mais horas por dia e a tentar ser mais \"eficiente\". Mais rápido e melhor traz oito conceitos-chave que explicam por que algumas pessoas e empresas são tão produtivas. Ao combinar sua incansável curiosidade, histórias instigantes e grandes reportagens com a experiência de profissionais de diversas áreas - CEOs, educadores, generais, agentes do FBI, pilotos de avião e compositores da Broadway -, Duhigg mostra como todos nós podemos alcançar o sucesso com menos estresse e esforço, fazer mais sem sacrificar o que estimamos e nos tornar mais rápidos e melhores em tudo o que fazemos.",

Many of our choices are not based on careful decision-making. They are instead habits and these habits have a tremendous influence on our health and productivity. Once we understand how habits are formed and how they work, we can learn how to change them. This book is divided into three parts. The first part focuses on the habits of individuals. In this section, DuHigg explains the habit loop and how habits work. A habit loop is made up of a cue or trigger, a routine, and a reward. DuHigg's examples show us how once habits are lodged in our brain, they influence how we act--often without our realizing it. Advertisers take advantage of our habits to convince us to buy their products. Advertisers know that cravings are what drive the habit loop from the cue to the routine to the reward and back again. They are also aware that knowing how to spark a craving is the key to creating a new habit...",

    "description": "THE PHENOMENAL INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER: OVER 15 MILLION COPIES SOLD WORLDWIDE Transform your life with tiny changes in behaviour, starting now. People think that when you want to change your life, you need to think big. But world-renowned habits expert James Clear has discovered another way. He knows that real change comes from the compound effect of hundreds of small decisions: doing two push-ups a day, waking up five minutes early, or holding a single short phone call. He calls them atomic habits. In this ground-breaking book, Clears reveals exactly how these minuscule changes can grow into such life-altering outcomes. He uncovers a handful of simple life hacks (the forgotten art of Habit Stacking, the unexpected power of the Two Minute Rule, or the trick to entering the Goldilocks Zone), and delves into cutting-edge psychology and neuroscience to explain why they matter. Along the way, he tells inspiring stories of Olympic gold medalists, leading CEOs, and distinguished scientists who have used the science of tiny habits to stay productive, motivated, and happy. These small changes will have a revolutionary effect on your career, your relationships, and your life. ________________________________ A NEW YORK TIMES AND SUNDAY TIMES BESTSELLER 'A supremely practical and useful book.'

Se é um corredor profissional, até pode saber a pouco. Mas se nunca correu na vida, o seu objetivo revela-se demasiado ambicioso – e condenado ao fracasso. No entanto, se usar A Regra dos Dois Minutos, e gastar apenas esse tempo a treinar todos os dias, é bem capaz de, sem dar por isso, estar a caminho da sua primeira maratona. A maior parte das pessoas pensa que para mudar de vida (ou mudar algo de relevante nas suas vidas) tem de pensar em grande. Mas um dos maiores especialistas mundiais em hábitos, James Clear, propõe uma alternativa. Após décadas de trabalho nessa área, concluiu que as grandes mudanças surgem do efeito combinado de centenas de pequenos atos – seja fazer uma elevação por dia ou acordar cinco minutos mais cedo. É o que o autor chama de Hábitos Atómicos.Neste livro revolucionário, o autor mostra passo a passo como usar essas minúsculas mudanças para conseguir resultados estruturantes na sua vida. Dá-nos as pequenas dicas (como A Regra dos 2 Minutos) mas sobretudo uma metodologia apoiada no melhor que a Psicologia e a Neurociência têm para oferecer. Vai assim ficar a conhecer as quatro leis para a formação de hábitos (a evidência, a atração, a facilidade e a gratificação), e como implementá-las. Sempre exemplificadas com histórias reais de cientistas, CEOs ou campeões olímpicos, que usaram a ciência dos pequenos hábitos para conseguir resultados absolutamente extraordinários.",

James Clear extrage informațiile fundamentale despre formarea obiceiurilor, astfel ca tu să poți realiza mai mult concentrându-te pe mai puține lucruri.\" – Mark Manson, autorul bestsellerului Arta subtilă a nepăsării „James Clear a petrecut ani de zile perfecționând arta și studiind știința obiceiurilor. Această carte antrenantă și practică este ghidul de care ai nevoie ca să scapi de deprinderile proaste și să-ți formezi unele bune.\" – Adam Grant, autorul bestsellerurilor Originalii și Option B. Inspirându-se din cele mai noi descoperiri din biologie, psihologie și neuroștiințe, James Clear a conceput un ghid ușor de asimilat, cu ajutorul căruia obiceiurile bune devin inevitabile, iar cele rele, imposibile. Învață: * să-ți construiești un sistem pentru a deveni cu 1% mai bun în fiecare zi; * să renunți la obiceiurile rele și să le păstrezi pe cele bune; * să eviți greșelile comise în general de cei care încearcă să-și schimbe obiceiurile; * să depășești lipsa de motivație și de voință; * să-ți dezvolți o identitate mai puternică și să crezi în tine însuți; * să-ți faci timp pentru noile obiceiuri (chiar și când viața o ia razna); * să-ți concepi un mediu care să favorizeze succesul; * să faci schimbări mici, ușoare, care oferă rezultate mari; * să-ți revii atunci când te abați de la drum; * și, cel mai important, cum să aplici aceste idei în viața reală… … și multe altele Indiferent dacă e vorba de o echipă care încearcă să câștige un campionat, o organizație care speră să redefinească o industrie sau pur și simplu un om care vrea să se lase de fumat, să slăbească, să reducă stresul ori să realizeze orice alt obiectiv, Atomic Habits este soluția. „Nu mă consider un expert și nu dețin toate răspunsurile, dar sunt fericit să împărtășesc ceea ce am învățat până acum.\" – James Clear „O carte deosebită, care îți va schimba felul în care îți organizezi ziua și îți trăiești viața.\" – Ryan Holiday, autorul bestsellerurilor The Obstacle is the Way și Ego is the Enemy „În Atomic Habits, Clear îți va arăta cum să depășești lipsa de motivație, cum să schimbi mediul înconjurător ca să încurajezi succesul și cum să-ți faci timp pentru obiceiuri noi și mai bune.\" – Glamour.com",

    "description": "Um dia, ao pilotar o seu helicóptero sobre a cidade de Glendale, Anthony Robbins ficou espantado com os engarrafamentos que via lá em baixo. Ao aproximar-se, apercebeu-se de que estava a sobrevoar o edifício onde, apenas 11 anos antes, trabalhava como empregado de limpeza; e que o caos no trânsito era provocado por milhares de pessoas que se deslocavam para o seu seminário. Em pouco mais de uma década, Anthony Robbins tinha dado um salto de gigante. Do rapaz pobre e com excesso de peso, que durante anos sustentou a custo a mãe e os irmãos, já nada restava. Aos comandos do helicóptero estava agora um homem de negócios bem-sucedido, multimilionário, que um dia aprendeu a explorar o seu enorme potencial. O segredo dessa extraordinária transformação é-nos revelado por Anthony Robbins em Desperte o Gigante que Há em Si. A receita que o autor nos oferece é a mesma que aplicou na própria vida: a concentração de poder. Por outras palavras concentrar todos os recursos numa única área da vida. Como fazê-lo é o que nos ensina este livro. Primeiro dota-nos das ferramentas para libertarmos o nosso poder; depois mostra como assumirmos o controlo desse poder; por fim, fornece um programa detalhado, de sete dias, para começarmos a moldar a nossa vida aos nossos objetivos.",

    "description": "From the renowned psychologist who introduced the world to “growth mindset” comes this updated edition of the million-copy bestseller—featuring transformative insights into redefining success, building lifelong resilience, and supercharging self-improvement. “Through clever research studies and engaging writing, Dweck illuminates how our beliefs about our capabilities exert tremendous influence on how we learn and which paths we take in life.”—Bill Gates, GatesNotes “It’s not always the people who start out the smartest who end up the smartest.” After decades of research, world-renowned Stanford University psychologist Carol S. Dweck, Ph.D., discovered a simple but groundbreaking idea: the power of mindset. In this brilliant book, she shows how success in school, work, sports, the arts, and almost every area of human endeavor can be dramatically influenced by how we think about our talents and abilities. People with a fixed mindset—those who believe that abilities are fixed—are less likely to flourish than those with a growth mindset—those who believe that abilities can be developed. Mindset reveals how great parents, teachers, managers, and athletes can put this idea to use to foster outstanding accomplishment. In this edition, Dweck offers new insights into her now famous and broadly embraced concept. She introduces a phenomenon she calls false growth mindset and guides people toward adopting a deeper, truer growth mindset. She also expands the mindset concept beyond the individual, applying it to the cultures of groups and organizations. With the right mindset, you can motivate those you lead, teach, and love—to transform their lives and your own.",

Dweck about human thoughts, and how these thoughts can greatly influence the way we live our everyday lives.

The author recognized that, based on her observations, there are two distinct, radically different mindsets; however, both of these separate mindsets can be connected with some success. Truly interesting literature to read and to study, Mindset: The New Psychology Today is a book that is here to open new horizons. The book itself is never boring or dull.

Esses princípios se aplicam a todos aqueles que procuram construir produtos verdadeiramente novos sem desperdício, que podem ser utilizados tanto por startups de empresas de garagem quanto por inovadores presentes nas grandes empresas. Ries, que é empreendedor residente na Harvard Business School, também define desperdício como \"toda atividade que não contribui para se aprender a respeito dos clientes\". Trazendo histórias da vida real e lições aprendidas de algumas das empresas mais dinâmicas da atualidade, o autor descreve um plano para que cada um possa executar os princípios fundamentais da startup enxuta em qualquer projeto.",

    "description": "Most startups fail. But many of those failures are preventable. The Lean Startup is a new approach being adopted across the globe, changing the way companies are built and new products are launched. Eric Ries defines a startup as an organization dedicated to creating something new under conditions of extreme uncertainty. This is just as true for one person in a garage or a group of seasoned professionals in a Fortune 500 boardroom. What they have in common is a mission to penetrate that fog of uncertainty to discover a successful path to a sustainable business. The Lean Startup approach fosters companies that are both more capital efficient and that leverage human creativity more effectively. Inspired by lessons from lean manufacturing, it relies on “validated learning,” rapid scientific experimentation, as well as a number of counter-intuitive practices that shorten product development cycles, measure actual progress without resorting to vanity metrics, and learn what customers really want. It enables a company to shift directions with agility, altering plans inch by inch, minute by minute. Rather than wasting time creating elaborate business plans, The Lean Startup offers entrepreneurs—in companies of all sizes—a way to test their vision continuously, to adapt and adjust before it’s too late. Ries provides a scientific approach to creating and managing successful startups in a age when companies need to innovate more than ever.",

Startups don't fail because of bad execution, or missed deadlines, or blown budgets. They fail because they are building something nobody wants. Whether they arise from someone's garage or are created within a mature Fortune 500 organization, new ventures, by definition, are designed to create new products or services under conditions of extreme uncertainly. Their primary mission is to find out what customers ultimately will buy. One of the central premises of The Lean Startup movement is what Ries calls \"validated learning\" about the customer. It is a way of getting continuous feedback from customers so that the company can shift directions or alter its plans inch by inch, minute by minute. Rather than creating an elaborate business plan and a product-centric approach, Lean Startup prizes testing your vision continuously with your customers and making constant adjustments\"--",

This summary of The Lean Startup (written by Eric Ries) is designed to give you the main ideas you need to know from this great book in the quickest format possible. What You Will Learn: How to manage and control a new startup How to use experiments to eliminate wasteful processes How to create a \"Minimum Viable Product\" How to use smart measurements to guarantee long-term success How to change directions and adapt quickly in a fast-paced, competitive environment How to scale an incredibly efficient new business using growth engines and innovation Many more hacks and strategies to build a lean and profitable startup What Is Inside This Summary: A comprehensive overview of the entire book Detailed summaries of each chapter Important and memorable quotes from each chapter A bulleted list of key takeaways from the book Excerpt from the summary of The Lean StartupThe Lean Startup MethodThe Lean Startup is comprised of five principles which make up the majority of the book. These principles include: Entrepreneurs are everywhere. Ries states that you don't have to be a business owner to be classified as an entrepreneur. This means that entrepreneurs can be found everywhere, in every sector of business, and in companies of varying size. Entrepreneurship is management. A startup is more than just the product or service being sold. If you think of a startup as an institution that constantly grows and changes based on the extreme uncertainty of the market, you start to get the idea. In fact, Ries even suggests making the term \"entrepreneur\" a managerial job title filled by someone who is adept at reacting to market changes as they occur. Validated Learning. One of the major benefits to creating a startup is learning how to build a sustainable business. In other words, it's about more than just creating products, making money, and serving customers. Build-Measure-Learn. The fundamental idea behind every startup is to turn an idea into a product, measure customer feedback, and then decide whether to change course or persevere. The Lean Startup method encourages accelerating this feedback loop as much as possible. Innovation Accounting. Measuring progress, setting up milestones, and learning how to prioritize tasks will help to improve entrepreneurial outcomes while holding innovators accountable. This is accomplished using a new accounting method designed specifically for startups Many of these principles are ideas originally developed by Toyota - a company which has spearheaded the lean manufacturing movement. Ries has taken the time to apply many of these same principles to businesses of all sizes, both startups and established companies. The result of Ries' work is known as the Lean Startup methodology.This book was written to welcome what Ries refers to as Management's Second Century. Modern startups cannot rely on what has worked in the past. Rather, startups require a new set of tactics - tactics that have been incorporated into the Lean Startup process. These tactics will ensure the future success of entrepreneurs around the world.",

    "description": "This is the world's first complete English translation of the art of war and the most accurate English translation in the world. In 1772, \"The Art of War\" was translated into French by missionaries, and a book of military theory that had influenced China for more than two thousand years was officially introduced into the Western world. In 1910, Lionel Giles translated the first English version of \"The Art of War\". Until today, there are as many as twenty or thirty English translation versions. Among them, the one that best conveys the original meaning of \"The Art of War\" belongs to the version translated by Samuel B. Griffith in 1963. However, even with this version, the true meaning of the \"The Art of War\" that it can convey is actually only about 50%. To find out how inaccurate these old English versions are, please refer to: https://ethanyet.blogspot.com/2020/04/those-words-that-sun-tzu-never-said.html",

    "description": "\"The Art of War\" is an ancient Chinese military treatise that is attributed to Sun Tzu (also referred to as \"Sunzi\" and \"Sun Wu\"), a high ranking military general, strategist and tactist. The Art of War has also been applied to business and managerial strategies. Composed of 13 chapters, each of which is devoted to one aspect of warfare. It is said to be the definitive work on military strategies and tactics of its time, and is still read for its military insight which can be applied to business and managerial strategies as well. Sun Tzu was a Chinese general, military strategist, and philosopher who lived in the Spring and Autumn period of ancient China. Sun Tzu is traditionally credited as the author of The Art of War, a widely influential work of military strategy that has affected both Western and Eastern philosophy. Aside from his legacy as the author of The Art of War, Sun Tzu is revered in Chinese and the Culture of Asia as a legendary historical figure. His birth name was Sun Wu, and he was known outside of his family by his courtesy name Changqing. The name Sun Tzu by which he is best known in the West is an honorific which means \"Master Sun\".",

    "description": "Composed by two prominent statesmen-generals of classical China, this book develops the strategies of Sun Tzu's classic, The Art of War , into a complete handbook of organization and leadership. The great leaders of ancient China who were trained in Sun Tzu's principles understood how war is waged successfully, both materially and mentally, and how victory and defeat follow clear social, psychological, and environmental laws. Drawing on episodes from the panorama of Chinese history, Mastering the Art of War presents practical summaries of these essential laws along with tales of conflict and strategy that show in concrete terms the proper use of Sun Tzu's principles. The book also examines the social and psychological aspects of organization and crisis management. The translator's introduction surveys the Chinese philosophies of war and conflict and explores in depth the parallels between The Art of War and the oldest handbook of strategic living, the I Ching (Book of Changes).",

In his breakthrough bestseller The Tipping Point, Malcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. Now, in Blink, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. Blink is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant--in the blink of an eye--that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work--in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others? In Blink we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of \"blink\": the election of Warren Harding; \"New Coke\"; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police. Blink reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of \"thin-slicing\"--filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables.",

    "description": "\"Um verdadeiro deleite. Repleto de insights surpreendentes sobre nosso mundo e nós mesmos.\" – Salon.com \"Gladwell cria outro fenômeno intelectual popular ao subverter o senso comum sobre a maneira como tomamos decisões.\" – Bookmarks Magazine Por que algumas pessoas são brilhantes ao tomar decisões e outras são incapazes de fazer a escolha certa? Por que algumas são bem-sucedidas ao seguir sua intuição enquanto outras se deixam levar por preconceitos e cometem grandes erros? Como nosso cérebro funciona no trabalho, na sala de aula, na cozinha e na cama? Baseado em fundamentos científicos, Blink é um livro sobre como podemos julgar, decidir e fazer escolhas sem refletir muito a respeito. Para explicar o conceito, Malcolm Gladwell apresenta histórias impressionantes, como o caso do especialista em arte que, num único relance, descobriu que uma escultura comprada por uma fortuna pelo Museu Getty era uma falsificação; o produtor que percebeu todo o potencial de Tom Hanks no instante em que o conheceu; o psicólogo que, só de observar um casal conversar por apenas alguns minutos, consegue prever quanto tempo vai durar aquele relacionamento; entre outras. Blink revela que, para tomar uma grande decisão, não é necessário processar mais informações ou deliberar por mais tempo, e sim desenvolver a arte de filtrar, a partir de inúmeras variáveis, as poucas informações que realmente importam.",

    "description": "Após um ano perdido, de uma década perdida, Gustavo Franco traz um balanço lúcido e provocador da situação do país Gustavo Franco, economista renomado e um dos formuladores do Plano Real, mobiliza sua conhecida independência intelectual, domínio dos dados e capacidade analítica para refletir não apenas sobre os problemas do país, mas sobre como a nossa forma de pensar a respeito deles vem se transformando, com profundas e imprevistas consequências. Sob o espectro da pandemia de covid-19, o autor toma as controvérsias que se impuseram ao longo de 2020 e 2021 como ponto de partida para uma análise eclética e inovadora, que abrange desde as razões da estagnação econômica durante o Império até as consequências da adoção do bitcoin e outras moedas digitais. Gustavo disseca também a questão das reformas, sempre presentes na discussão nacional, reconhecidas como necessárias pela maioria dos protagonistas da vida pública, mas que ficam velhas antes mesmo de serem aprovadas. Com lógica implacável, ele demonstra como o próprio conceito de reforma foi cooptado pelo estamento político para a construção de um discurso pretensamente modernizador, mas, na prática, voltado para o adiamento de qualquer mudança que contrarie poderosos interesses. “Tudo parece ter ficado mais agudo e urgente, assim como parece ter reduzido a nossa tolerância com a procrastinação. Ou não?”, ele provoca. Lições amargas transborda de ideias originais, mercadoria escassa no cenário atual dominado pelo debate raso, dissociado dos fatos, prisioneiro dos dogmas. É menos um livro sobre as nossas dificuldades, e mais sobre a nossa incapacidade secular de enfrentá-las. Com fina ironia e genuína erudição, Gustavo Franco tira lições amargas dos anos de estagnação e da nossa inelutável tendência aos remédios milagrosos, para traçar os caminhos acidentados, porém ainda possíveis, de um reencontro com a nação que desejamos ser.",

Blink reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of \"thin-slicing\" - filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables. Drawing on cutting-edge neuroscience and psychology and displaying all of the brilliance that made The Tipping Point a classic, Blink changes the way you understand every decision you make. Never again will you think about thinking the same way.",

ORIGINAL BOOK DESCRIPTION: Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking by Malcolm Gladwell In his landmark bestseller The Tipping Point, Malcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. Now, in Blink, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. Blink is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant-in the blink of an eye-that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work-in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others?In Blink we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance.

Para pessoas assim, a leitura das Escrituras é como uma viagem por terras desconhecidas usando um guia cheio de enigmas. O estudo bíblico se torna um grande desafio, pois são muitos livros cheios de nomes de lugares e pessoas, além de vários fatos históricos e diversas mensagens, nem sempre muito claras. Com o objetivo de tornar essa jornada mais tranquila e enriquecedora, os teólogos Gordon Fee e Douglas Stuart se propõem a tomar o leitor pela mão e desvendar a Palavra de Deus, livro por livro, detalhe por detalhe. Para tornar a exposição do conteúdo de cada livro da bíblia ainda mais clara e acessível, os autores se valem de um método de abordagem gradual. Confira os recursos de estudo: - Informações básicas: os autores começam oferecendo um resumo do livro com suas principais características. - Visão geral: neste tópico, o leitor é apresentado aos temas e conceitos fundamentais, bem como aos fatos mais marcantes da narrativa bíblica. - Orientações para a leitura: um recurso para análise bíblica, que potencializa a assimilação das lições e mensagens importantes, com detalhes que contextualizam e esclarecem ainda mais o texto. - Uma caminhada por: outro expediente de grande utilidade, em que a leitura é conduzida por cada segmento do livro bíblico, facilitando o encadeamento das ideias e dos acontecimentos e propiciando uma visão panorâmica.

    "description": "The Quran, literally meaning \"the recitation,\" also romanised (Koran) is the central religious text of Islam, which Muslims believe to be a revelation from God (Arabic: Allah). It is widely regarded as the finest piece of literature in the Arabic language. Muslims consider the Quran to be the only book that has been protected by God from distortion or corruption. Quranic chapters are called suras and verses are called ayahs. Muslims believe that the Quran was verbally revealed from God to Muhammad through the angel Gabriel (Jibril), gradually over a period of approximately 23 years, beginning on 22 December 609 CE, when Muhammad (Peace be upon Him) was 40, and concluding in 632 CE, the year of his death. Shortly after Muhammad's death, the Quran was collected by his companions using written Quranic materials and everything that had been memorized of the Quran. Muslims regard the Quran as the most important miracle of Muhammad, the proof of his prophet hood and the culmination of a series of divine messages that started with the messages revealed to Adam and ended with Muhammad. The Quran assumes familiarity with major narratives recounted in the Jewish and Christian scriptures. It summarizes some, dwells at length on others and, in some cases, presents alternative accounts and interpretations of events. The Quran describes itself as a book of guidance. It sometimes offers detailed accounts of specific historical events, and it often emphasizes the moral significance of an event over its narrative sequence. The Quran is used along with the hadith to interpret sharia law. During prayers, the Quran is recited only in Arabic. Someone who has memorized the entire Quran is called a hafiz. Some Muslims read Quranic ayahs (verses) with elocution, which is often called tajweed. During the month of Ramadan, Muslims typically complete the recitation of the whole Quran during tarawih prayers. Inimitability of the Quran (or \"I'jaz\") is the belief that no human speech can match the Quran in its content and form. The Quran is considered an inimitable miracle by Muslims, effective until the Day of Resurrection-and, thereby, the central proof granted to Muhammad in authentication of his prophetic status. The concept of inimitability originates in the Quran where in five different verses challenges opponents to produce something like the Quran: \"If men and sprites banded together to produce the like of this Quran they would never produce its like not though they backed one another\" (17:88). So the suggestion is that if there are doubts concerning the divine authorship of the Quran come forward and create something like it. From the ninth century, numerous works appeared which studied the Quran and examined its style and content. Medieval Muslim scholars including al-Jurjani (d. 1078CE) and al-Baqillani (d. 1013CE) have written treatises on the subject, discussed its various aspects, and used linguistic approaches to study the Quran. Others argue that the Quran contains noble ideas, has inner meanings, maintained its freshness through the ages and has caused great transformations in individual level and in the history. Some scholars state that the Quran contains scientific information that agrees with modern science. The doctrine of miraculousness of the Quran is further emphasized by Muhammad's illiteracy since the unlettered prophet could not have been suspected of composing the Quran.",

Comprised of eighteen chapters taken from the great Sanskrit epic Mahabharata, the Gita presents a conversation that takes place on a battlefield just as two groups of relatives are about to wage war against one another. Facing the forces of greed, anger, and hatred, the warrior-prince Arjuna loses heart and refuses to fight his own kin. His friend and charioteer, Lord Krishna, who represents the Divine within, tells him: \"Your very nature will drive you to fight.\" In the ensuing dialogue, Krishna teaches Arjuna, and all of us, how we can face bravely the unavoidable challenges and conflicts of life--and win the greatest of all battles, against the tumultuous emotions within our own hearts. Eknath Easwaran's eloquent translation and Diana Morrison's chapter introductions, which summarize major religious concepts, make this edition especially accessible for modern readers of any religion.",

The morning prayer meetings were followed by his discourses and discussions on the Bhagavad Gita.",

    "description": "In this companion to his best-selling translation of the Bhagavad Gita, Easwaran explores the essential themes of this much-loved Indian scripture. Placing the Gita in a modern context, Easwaran shows how this classic text sheds light on the nature of reality, the illusion of separateness, the search for identity, and the meaning of yoga. The key message of the Gita is how to resolve our conflicts and live in harmony with the deep unity of life, through the principles of yoga and the practice of meditation. Easwaran grew up in the Hindu tradition and learned Sanskrit from an early age. A foremost translator and interpreter of the Gita, he taught classes on it for forty years, while living out the principles of the Gita in the midst of a busy family and community life. In the Gita, Sri Krishna, the Lord, doesn’t tell the warrior prince Arjuna what to do: he shows Arjuna his choices and then leaves it to Arjuna to decide. Easwaran, too, shows us clearly how these teachings still apply to us – and how, like Arjuna, we must take courage and act wisely if we want our world to thrive.",

    "description": "If there is one book that can claim to provide the solution to all problems of humanity, it is the holy Bhagavad Gita. Simply reading this book and comprehending the life-changing, ageless, and profound wisdom contained in its 701 magnificent verses is enough to change the path of one’s life and bring it to the peak of perfection. That is why, after hearing this transcendental discourse of Lord Krishna, Arjuna exclaims to Him, “O Achyuta (The Changeless One), my delusion is destroyed, and my memory (about one’s true identity) has been regained by me through Your grace. I am firmly situated; my doubts are gone. I will now act according to Your word.” [Bhagavad Gita 18.73] The Bhagavad Gita is not a religious book and is not intended to be read and acted upon by the adherents of a particular religion. It’s a guidebook for life; a how-to manual. It is a medicine for the infected souls of the Kali-Yuga, the dark age. And there is no religion in medicine. The Bhagavad Gita is the most sacred conversation ever between Lord Krishna and his friend Prince Arjuna just before the beginning of the great war of Mahabharata, on the holy battlefield of Kurukshetra, where the Lord enlightens a bewildered Arjuna about the biggest truths of the universe. This dialogue is considered to contain the nectar of all Vedic scriptures, the most ancient scriptures of the world. By reading the Bhagavad Gita, you will discover answers to the most important questions in life, such as: - Who are you? - What is your purpose in life and how to fulfill that purpose? - Is there a God? If yes, who is God, and how to know and reach Him? - Is God one or many? - What is your relationship with God? - What is death and why you do not need to fear death? - What happens after death? - Do heaven and hell exist? - Is reincarnation real? - What is Yoga? What are the different types of Yoga? How to be a Yogi? - How does the Law of Karma work? - Why are we all living life the wrong way? And how you can live your life the right way? - How to see yourself and your life from the right perspective? - How to master your mind and get rid of negative emotions like worry, fear, anger, jealousy, and sadness for good? - How to be always happy? - What is the most perfect method of meditation? Hari Chetan’s translation of the Bhagavad Gita is the outcome of his two decades of experience in the field of Vedic philosophy. The following are some of the distinguishing aspects of this English translation: - All the verses of the Bhagavad Gita are accurately translated from the original Sanskrit texts. - The translations are presented in their authentic form, free from any sectarian bias. - The translations are kept simple without sacrificing accuracy, essence, and spirit. - The gaps arising while translating verses from Sanskrit to English have been taken care of to preserve the intended meaning of each verse. - Context has been given due importance while establishing the meaning of each word with the aim of providing correct interpretation. - To facilitate self-explanatory translations, additional explanations are given in parentheses in the verses. - Additional explanations are provided in the form of notes at appropriate places. - The historical background of Mahabharata is included for perfect understanding. - To help you test your understanding, a printable workbook is included. All of this adds up to a complete translation of the holy Bhagavad Gita in English. Read This Book to Uncover The Secret Wisdom of the Bhagavad Gita and Change Your Life Forever!",

    "description": "The life and times of India's most famous spiritual and literary masterpiece The Bhagavad Gita, perhaps the most famous of all Indian scriptures, is universally regarded as one of the world's spiritual and literary masterpieces. Richard Davis tells the story of this venerable and enduring book, from its origins in ancient India to its reception today as a spiritual classic that has been translated into more than seventy-five languages. The Gita opens on the eve of a mighty battle, when the warrior Arjuna is overwhelmed by despair and refuses to fight. He turns to his charioteer, Krishna, who counsels him on why he must. In the dialogue that follows, Arjuna comes to realize that the true battle is for his own soul. Davis highlights the place of this legendary dialogue in classical Indian culture, and then examines how it has lived on in diverse settings and contexts. He looks at the medieval devotional traditions surrounding the divine character of Krishna and traces how the Gita traveled from India to the West, where it found admirers in such figures as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, J. Robert Oppenheimer, and Aldous Huxley. Davis explores how Indian nationalists like Mahatma Gandhi and Swami Vivekananda used the Gita in their fight against colonial rule, and how contemporary interpreters reanimate and perform this classical work for audiences today. An essential biography of a timeless masterpiece, this book is an ideal introduction to the Gita and its insights into the struggle for self-mastery that we all must wage.",

Lewis’s reputation as one of the leading writers and thinkers of our age.",

Mere Christianity is a theological book and is considered a classic of Christian apologetics, the transcripts of the broadcasts originally appeared in print as three separate pamphlets: The Case for Christianity (1942), Christian Behaviour (1943), and Beyond Personality (1944). Lewis, an Anglican, intended to describe the Christian common ground. In Mere Christianity, he aims at avoiding controversies to explain fundamental teachings of Christianity, for the sake of those basically educated as well as the intellectuals of his generation, for whom the jargon of formal Christian theology did not retain its original meaning. Clive Staples Lewis (1898-1963) was a British novelist, poet, academic, medievalist, literary critic, essayist, lay theologian, lecturer, and Christian apologist. He is best known for his fictional work, especially The Screwtape Letters, The Chronicles of Narnia, and The Space Trilogy, and for his non-fiction Christian apologetics, such as Mere Christianity, Miracles, and The Problem of Pain.",

George Marsden describes how Lewis gradually went from being an atheist to a committed Anglican—famously converting to Christianity in 1931 after conversing into the night with his friends J. R. R. Tolkien and Hugh Dyson—and how his plainspoken case for Christianity went on to become one of the most beloved spiritual books of all time.",

Mais tarde, ajustado pelo próprio Lewis, esse material daria origem a Cristianismo puro e simples, um grande clássico da literatura cristã. Na obra mais popular e acessível de seu legado, Lewis apresenta os principais elementos da cosmovisão cristã e seus princípios básicos, gradativamente conduzindo o leitor a temas mais profundos e complexos, provocando reflexão e debate.

Some of the stories you hear about him sound like just that--stories. A reasonable person would never believe them, let alone the claim that he's the only way to God! But a reasonable person would also make sure that he or she understood the facts before jumping to conclusions. That's why Lee Strobel--an award-winning legal journalist with a knack for asking tough questions--decided to investigate Jesus for himself. An atheist, Strobel felt certain his findings would bring Christianity's claims about Jesus tumbling down like a house of cards. He was in for the surprise of his life. Join him as he retraces his journey from skepticism to faith. You'll consult expert testimony as you sift through the truths that history, science, psychiatry, literature, and religion reveal. Like Strobel, you'll be amazed at the evidence--how much there is, how strong it is, and what it says. The facts are in. What will your verdict be in The Case for Christ?",

    "description": "Após pouco mais de dois milênios, olhar para a figura histórica de Jesus Cristo e os evangelhos exige, antes de tudo, um exercício de fé. Afinal, o homem que nasceu em Belém da Judeia, andou nas empoeiradas ruas de Nazaré e morreu como um criminoso, numa cruz em Jerusalém, ao lado de ladrões, não seria apenas o filho de José, o carpinteiro? A desconfiança de que Deus, Todo-poderoso, não poderia ser apenas um aprendiz de marceneiro, com mãos calejadas e feridas pela labuta, ainda latejam mentes e corações deste século 21. Outrora agnóstico, o autor Josh McDowell desconfiou. Sua primeira experiência como apologista foi após uma tensa reunião em sua faculdade. Queria provar que os argumentos históricos da ressurreição eram frágeis. E, após meses de empreitada, pesquisando em bibliotecas dos Estados Unidos e Europa, levou um susto. Os documentos que faziam parte do Antigo e do Novo Testamento bíblico eram os mais confiáveis da História antiga. Mais que um carpinteiro atingiu recordes importantes na história dos livros cristãos, como: ser o primeiro livro cristão traduzido em mais de 100 idiomas, e atingir a marca de mais de 15 milhões de exemplares vendidos no mundo, na edição da década de 1970. Nesta nova edição, ampliada e atualizada, Mais que um carpinteiro, obra originalmente lançada em 1976, Josh e seu filho, o apologista Sean McDowell, trazem para o século 21 os dilemas e respostas da historicidade cristã. Num cenário onde o ateísmo e outras doutrinas tentam transformar em mito a verdade dos evangelhos, a nova versão da obra é um agudo testemunho da veracidade histórica de Cristo e sua ressurreição. Em 13 capítulos, o leitor passa dos argumentos científicos aos teológicos com inúmeras referências bíblicas e uma profunda argumentação baseada em amplo conhecimento exegético - do porquê das declarações de Jesus, e como elas evidenciam a sua divindade, e o sentido de seu sacrifício e ressurreição. Para os recém-convertidos, é um nutrido material que responde a vários questionamentos simples do primeiro amor, lançando alicerces firmes na fé, que desafiam a práxis da evangelização.",

For Christians, it will deepen their convictions and give them fresh confidence in defending their faith to skeptical friends, or during the hardest of times, when they have to defend their faith to themselves in moments of doubt.

And each short, two-page devotion helps kids “examine the case” when it comes to Jesus and apply those truths to their everyday lives.

Tao é o caminho que leva à iluminação e a uma vida calma e pacífica. Ao mesmo tempo, o Tao é a origem de todos os seres e a unidade dos opostos. O caminho taoísta é caracterizado pela compaixão, moderação, renúncia à ação humana e rejeição da violência. O Tao Te Ching é uma chamada de despertar para todos em uma jornada de auto-conscientização. Dominar a arte do equilíbrio e aceitar a dualidade da vida ajuda você a entender melhor a vida. É missão de todos prosperar e alcançar a melhor versão de si mesmos. Você pode alcançá-la vivendo de forma consciente e em harmonia com a natureza. Tao Te Ching é um livro que, quando escrito, estava muitos séculos à frente de seu tempo e ainda tem muito a dizer aos leitores de hoje.",

    "description": "For nearly two generations, this translation of the Tao Te Ching has been the standard for those seeking access to the wisdom of Taoist thought. Now Jane English and her long-time editor, Toinette Lippe, have refreshed and revised the translation, so that it more faithfully reflects the Classical Chinese in which it was first written, while taking into account changes in our own language and eliminating any lingering infelicities. Lao Tsu’s philosophy is simple: Accept what is in front of you without wanting the situation to be other than it is. Study the natural order of things and work with it rather than against it, for to try to change what is only sets up resistance. Nature provides everything without requiring payment or thanks. It does so without discrimination. So let us present the same face to everyone and treat them all as equals, however they may behave. If we watch carefully, we will see that work proceeds more quickly and easily if we stop “trying,” if we stop putting in so much extra effort, if we stop looking for results. In the clarity of a still and open mind, truth will be reflected. Te—which may be translated as “virtue” or “strength”—lies always in Tao meaning “the way” or “natural law.” In other words: Simply be.",

    "description": "The original mindfulness book, in a landmark new translation by the award-winning translator of the I Ching and The Art of War The most translated book in the world after the Bible, the Tao Te Ching, or “Book of the Tao,” is a guide to cultivating a life of peace, serenity, and compassion. Through aphorisms and parable, it leads readers toward the Tao, or the “Way”: harmony with the life force of the universe. Traditionally attributed to Lao-tzu, a Chinese philosopher thought to have been a contemporary of Confucius, it is the essential text of Taoism, one of the three major religions of ancient China. As one of the world’s great works of wisdom literature, it still has much to teach us today, offering a practical model based on modesty and self-restraint for living a balanced existence and for opening your mind, freeing your thoughts, and attaining greater self-awareness. With its emphasis on calm, simplicity, purity, and non-action, it provides a time-tested refuge from the busyness of modern life. This new translation seeks to understand the Tao Te Ching as a guide to everyday living and encourages a slow, meditative reading experience. The Tao Te Ching’s eighty-one brief chapters are accompanied by illuminating commentary, interpretation, poems, and testimonials by the likes of Margaret Mead, Ursula K. Le Guin, and Dr. Wayne W. Dyer. Specially commissioned calligraphy for more than two hundred Chinese characters illustrates the book’s essential themes.",

    "description": "\"Lao Tzu. 'Tao Te Ching' stands as an ancient philosophical masterpiece, encapsulating the wisdom of Taoism. This foundational text, believed to have been written in the 6th century BCE, offers profound insights into the nature of existence, the principles of harmony, and the art of virtuous living. Comprising 81 verses, 'Tao Te Ching' explores the concept of Tao, the unnameable and ineffable force that underlies and unites all aspects of the universe. Lao Tzu imparts timeless teachings on the virtue of simplicity, the power of yielding, and the importance of aligning with the natural order. The verses delve into the duality of Yin and Yang, emphasizing balance and the interconnectedness of opposites. Lao Tzu advocates for a harmonious way of life, rooted in humility, compassion, and non-action (Wu Wei). He presents the idea that true wisdom lies in embracing the ebb and flow of life without undue interference. This enduring classic challenges conventional thinking and invites readers to contemplate the essence of existence, urging them to align with the Tao to attain a state of inner peace and enlightenment. 'Tao Te Ching' continues to be a source of inspiration for those seeking spiritual guidance, ethical principles, and a deeper understanding of the universal flow of existence.",

    "description": "Regarded as sacred scripture by millions, the Book of Mormon -- first published in 1830 -- is one of the most significant documents in American religious history. This new reader-friendly version reformats the complete, unchanged 1920 text in the manner of modern translations of the Bible, with paragraphs, quotations marks, poetic forms, topical headings, multichapter headings, indention of quoted documents, italicized reworkings of biblical prophecies, and minimized verse numbers. It also features a hypothetical map based on internal references, an essay on Book of Mormon poetry, a full glossary of names, genealogical charts, a basic bibliography of Mormon and non-Mormon scholarship, a chronology of the translation, eyewitness accounts of the gold plates, and information regarding the lost 116 pages and significant changes in the text. The Book of Mormon claims to be the product of three historical interactions: the writings of the original ancient American authors, the editing of the fourth-century prophet Mormon, and the translation of Joseph Smith. The editorial aids and footnotes in this edition integrate all three perspectives and provide readers with a clear guide through this complicated text. New readers will find the story accessible and intelligible; Mormons will gain fresh insights from familiar verses seen in a broader narrative context. This is the first time the Book of Mormon has been published with quotation marks, select variant readings, and the testimonies of women involved in the translation process. It is also the first return to a paragraphed format since versification was added in 1879.",

    "description": "Mark Twain once derided the Book of Mormon as \"chloroform in print.\" Long and complicated, written in the language of the King James version of the Bible, it boggles the minds of many. Yet it is unquestionably one of the most influential books ever written. With over 140 million copies in print, it is a central text of one of the largest and fastest-growing faiths in the world. And, Grant Hardy shows, it's far from the coma-inducing doorstop caricatured by Twain. In Understanding the Book of Mormon, Hardy offers the first comprehensive analysis of the work's narrative structure in its 180 year history. Unlike virtually all other recent world scriptures, the Book of Mormon presents itself as an integrated narrative rather than a series of doctrinal expositions, moral injunctions, or devotional hymns. Hardy takes readers through its characters, events, and ideas, as he explores the story and its messages. He identifies the book's literary techniques, such as characterization, embedded documents, allusions, and parallel narratives. Whether Joseph Smith is regarded as author or translator, it's noteworthy that he never speaks in his own voice; rather, he mediates nearly everything through the narrators Nephi, Mormon, and Moroni. Hardy shows how each has a distinctive voice, and all are woven into an integral whole. As with any scripture, the contending views of the Book of Mormon can seem irreconcilable. For believers, it is an actual historical document, transmitted from ancient America. For nonbelievers, it is the work of a nineteenth-century farmer from upstate New York. Hardy transcends this intractable conflict by offering a literary approach, one appropriate to both history and fiction. Regardless of whether readers are interested in American history, literature, comparative religion, or even salvation, he writes, the book can best be read if we examine the text on its own terms.",

    "description": "The Book of Mormon is a sacred text of the Latter Day Saint movement, which contains writings of ancient prophets who lived on the American continent from approximately 2200 BC to AD 421. The Book of Mormon is the earliest of the unique writings of the Latter-day Saint movement, the denominations of which typically regard the text primarily as scripture, and secondarily as a historical record of God's dealings with the ancient inhabitants of the Americas. According to Smith's account and the book's narrative, the Book of Mormon was originally written in otherwise unknown characters referred to as \"reformed Egyptian\" engraved on golden plates. Smith said that the last prophet to contribute to the book, a man named Moroni, buried it in the Hill Cumorah in present-day Manchester, New York, before his death, and then appeared in a vision to Smith in 1827 as an angel, revealing the location of the plates, and instructing him to translate the plates into English for use in the restoration of Christ's true church in the latter days",

    "description": "One of the most influential and well-loved books of Christianity, The Imitation of Christ by Thomas à Kempis appears here in Penguin Classics in a new translation by Robert Jeffery, with an introduction by Max Von Habsburg, notes, a chronology and further reading. The Imitation of Christ is a passionate celebration of God's love, mercy and holiness, which has stimulated religious devotion for over five hundred years. With great personal conviction and deep humanity, Thomas à Kempis (1380-1471) demonstrates the individual's reliance on God and on the words of Christ, and the futility of a life without faith, as well as exploring the ideas such as humility, compassion, patience and tolerance. Thomas spent some seventy years of his life in the reclusive environment of monasteries, yet in this astonishing work he demonstrates an encompassing understanding of human nature, while his writing speaks to readers of every age and every nation. Thomas à Kempis was born at Kempen near Dusseldorf in 1380. He received the priesthood in 1413. Thomas wrote many other devotional works besides The Imitation of Christ, his masterpiece, as well as biographies of Gerald Groote and Florentius Radewyn. He died in 1471. The Very Revd Robert Jeffery was born in 1935 and ordained in 1959. He has written on matters of Church history, spirituality, mission and ecumenism. In 1978, he became Archdeacon of Salop, and was Dean of Worcester from 1987-96 and subsequently Canon and Sub-Dean of Christ Church, Oxford. He retired in 2002 and is an Hon Doctor of Divinity of Birmingham University. Max von Habsburg is the author of Catholic and Protestant Translations of the Imitatio Christi 1425-1650 (2011).",

    "description": "The spiritual classic by À Kempis, the second most widely read spiritual book after the Bible, has had an astonishing impact on the spiritual lives of countless saints, peasants, and popes for centuries. Even today, the soul-searching words of the fifteenth-century cleric Thomas À Kempis continue to resonate, unbounded by time or geography. Drawing on the Bible, the Fathers of the early Church and medieval mysticism, his four-part treatise shrugs off the allure of the material world, blending beauty and bluntness in a supremely spiritual call-to-arms. This beautiful translation by Ronald Knox and Michael Oakley is considered by many teachers, writers, and readers to be the best English translation ever, and one that greatly enhances the life-changing insights of Thomas À Kempis. Illustrated. \"If we could construct a composite picture of all great Christians-Catholic or non-Catholic-of the last five hundred years who found The Imitation substantially beneficial, enlightening, and inspiring, we would need no further proof that familiarity with this great classic is an integral part of a mature spiritual life and even a path to holiness.\" -Father Benedict J.

A Kempis lived as intentionally as he wrote. We must turn away from the things of this world, we must live sacrificially, we must be inundated with Christ's passionate teaching, and we must pray to be removed from distraction. A classic in every state of the word, The Imitation of Christ places the fruit of one man's single-minded devotion to God's calling on his life within the reach of every reader. May we all commit to be this effective in our emulation of Jesus. Moody Classics Of all the factors influencing our spiritual growth and development, pivotal books play a key role. Learning from those who have walked the path and fought the fight brings wisdom and strengthens resolve. And hearing the familiar chords of kingdom living sung by voices from other times can penetrate cultural barriers that limit our allegiance to the King. To this end, Moody Publishers is honored to introduce the first six volumes in what is to be an ongoing series of spiritual classics. Selected for their enduring influence and timeless perspective, these new editions promise to shape the lives of spiritual pilgrims for generations to come.",

Cada frase transmite verdade e poder.\" – Deepak Chopra, autor de As sete leis espirituais do sucesso. Nós passamos a maior parte de nossas vidas pensando no passado e fazendo planos para o futuro. Ignoramos ou negamos o presente e adiamos nossas conquistas para algum dia distante, quando conseguiremos tudo o que desejamos e seremos, finalmente, felizes. Mas, se queremos realmente mudar nossas vidas, precisamos começar neste momento. Essa é a mensagem simples, mas transformadora de Eckhart Tolle: viver no Agora é o melhor caminho para a felicidade e a iluminação. Para compreender a jornada em direção a O poder do agora, a primeira coisa a fazer é deixar para trás nossa mente analítica e nosso falso ego. Desde o primeiro capítulo subiremos rapidamente para uma altitude mais elevada, onde se respira um ar mais leve, o ar espiritual. Embora seja uma travessia desafiadora, Eckhart Tolle nos guia com sua linguagem simples e facilita o entendimento de conceitos complexos ao escrever no formato de perguntas e respostas. Combinando conceitos do cristianismo, do budismo, do hinduísmo, do taoísmo e de outras tradições espirituais, Tolle elaborou um guia de grande eficiência para a descoberta do nosso potencial interior. Esse livro é um manual prático que nos ensina a tomar consciência dos pensamentos e das emoções que nos impedem de vivenciar plenamente a alegria e a paz que estão dentro de nós mesmos.",

Muitos de nós amamos os livros e vários deles até permanecem na nossa memória algumas semanas depois de lidos, mas depois de 2 anos não podemos mais nos lembrar se o lemos de fato ou não. E isso não é bom. Lembramos que, na época, tal livro significava muito para nós. Por que é que esquecemos tudo depois? Este resumo expressa as ideias mais importantes do livro original. Muitas pessoas não gostam de ler, só querem saber o que o livro diz que elas devem fazer. Se você confia no autor, não precisa dos argumentos. A maioria dos livros são argumentos para as ideias do leitor, mas muitas vezes não precisamos de argumentos se confiamos na fonte. Podemos entender a ideia imediatamente. Toda esta informação está no livro original. Este resumo faz o esforço de reduzir redundâncias e transformá-las em instruções diretas para as pessoas que não pretendem ler o livro em sua totalidade.

    "description": "“To me, this is the greatest book ever written. . . . It is the definitive text on self-discipline, personal ethics, humility, self-actualization, and strength. . . . If you’re going to read it, you absolutely have to go with the Gregory Hays translation.”—Ryan Holiday, #1 New York Times bestselling author of The Obstacle Is the Way “It is unbelievable to see how the emperor’s words have stood the test of time. . . . Read a page or two anytime you feel like the world is too much.”—Arnold Schwarzenegger, The Wall Street Journal Nearly two thousand years after it was written, Meditations remains profoundly relevant for anyone seeking to lead a meaningful life. Your ability to control your thoughts—treat it with respect. It’s all that protects your mind from false perceptions—false to your nature, and that of all rational beings. A series of spiritual exercises filled with wisdom, practical guidance, and profound understanding of human behavior, Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations remains one of the greatest works of spiritual and ethical reflection ever written. With bite-size insights and advice on everything from living in the world to coping with adversity and interacting with others, Meditations has become required reading not only for statesmen and philosophers alike, but also for generations of readers who responded to the straightforward intimacy of his style. In Gregory Hays’s translation—the first in nearly four decades—Marcus’s thoughts speak with a new immediacy. In fresh and unencumbered English, Hays vividly conveys the spareness and compression of the original Greek text. Never before have Marcus’s insights been so directly and powerfully presented. With an Introduction that outlines Marcus’s life and career, the essentials of Stoic doctrine, the style and construction of the Meditations, and the work’s ongoing influence, this edition makes it possible to fully rediscover the thoughts of one of the most enlightened and intelligent leaders of any era.",

    "description": "'Their icy blasts are refreshing and restorative. They tell you the worst. And having heard the worst, you feel less bad' Blake Morrison Written in Greek by the only Roman emperor who was also a philosopher, without any intention of publication, the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius offer a remarkable series of challenging spiritual reflections and exercises developed as the emperor struggled to understand himself and make sense of the universe. While the Meditations were composed to provide personal consolation and encouragement, Marcus Aurelius also created one of the greatest of all works of philosophy: a timeless collection that has been consulted and admired by statesmen, thinkers and readers throughout the centuries. Translated with notes by MARTIN HAMMOND with an Introduction by DISKIN CLAY",

    "description": "\"Di dalam jurnal pribadi Kaisar Marcus Aurelius ini kita belajar sosok manusia biasa yang harus melawan kecemasan, kekecewaan, kegetiran, dan hawa nafsu yang juga adalah perjuangan kita sehari-hari.\" —Henry Manampiring, Penulis Filosofi Teras *** Walaupun ditulis hampir dua milenium yang lalu, karya Kaisar Romawi, Marcus Aurelius ini, masih sangat relevan bagi kehidupan sekarang yang penuh tekanan. Ajaran-ajarannya mengandung unsur mindfulness, mengajak untuk fokus pada yang kita lakukan saat ini, move on dari masa lalu, sekaligus melepaskan beban-beban kekhawatiran akan masa depan. Memotivasi kita untuk berhenti overthinking, terlalu banyak memikirkan pendapat orang, dan mulai melakukan sesuatu yang bermanfaat bagi diri sendiri dan lingkungan sekitar. Dengan Meditations, Marcus meyakinkan kita, “Kamu memiliki kemampuan untuk hidup bebas tanpa tekanan dan dengan rasa damai dalam pikiranmu, bahkan jika semua orang di seluruh dunia berteriak melawanmu.” Sisakan sedikit waktu menapaki renungan-renungan yang telah menjadi acuan para negarawan, pemikir, dan banyak orang di seluruh dunia selama berabad-abad ini. Mulailah perjalananmu memahami diri sendiri sekaligus memahami dunia. *** \"Marcus Aurelius mengajak kita menyelami isi pikirannya. Di dalamnya kita akan menemukan kesadaran diri untuk tetap tenang menjalani hidup bahkan di saat-saat yang serba tidak pasti seperti sekarang ini.” —Adjie Santosoputro, Pembantu Memulihkan Batin, Praktisi Meditasi dan Mindfulness [Mizan, Noura Books, Noura Publishing, Filosofi, Pemikiran, Indonesia]",

Marcus Aurelius wrote the Meditations as a source for his own guidance and self-improvement. The Meditations is divided into 12 books that chronicle different periods of Marcus' life. A central theme to Meditations is the importance of analyzing one's judgment of self and others and the development of a cosmic perspective. The style of writing that permeates the text is one that is simplified, straightforward, and perhaps reflecting Marcus' Stoic perspective on the text.",

    "description": "Marcus Aurelius, emperor of Rome, may be the closest mankind has ever come to producing the philosopher king that Plato envisioned in The Republic. A reluctant ruler and a reluctant warrior, much of his reign was spent in battle, defending the frontiers of the empire from the \"barbarian\" hordes. Fortunately for us, he carried a notebook along on his military campaigns, and thus we have the Meditations. Marcus's writings reveal him to be the last and greatest of the classical Stoics. Stoicism is a school of thought that asserts we have no control over our lives, only control over our perceptions. It advocates that the best life is the life that is lived in accordance with nature (not \"nature\" as in grass and trees, but \"nature\" as in the order of the universe). By concentrating one's thoughts and choices on what is good and virtuous, and disregarding the unimportant distractions of everyday life (even life and death are said to be neither good nor bad, but \"indifferent\"), we can avoid negative emotions like fear, anger, grief, and frustration, and live a life of happiness and tranquility. That's an oversimplification, of course. If you really want to know what Stoicism is and how it works read Epictetus or Seneca. What Marcus provides us with are the reflections of a man who studied and lived the Stoic life, and was its ultimate exemplar. Even if you don't buy into Stoicism, or have no interest in Philosophy with a capital P, you can still find inspiration and solace in the Meditations, as Marcus instructs us in dealing justly with others, overcoming emotional hardship, living life to the fullest by overcoming the fear of death, and resigning oneself to the insignificance of man in the universe. The Meditations are divided into twelve books. Each book contains anywhere from 16 to 75 numbered paragraphs, ranging in length from a sentence to a page. The paragraphs are arranged without regard to sequence or subject matter. This haphazard method of compilation is really the book's only flaw. What the Meditations has always needed is a good index, but I've never found a volume that has one. It is a pleasure to publish this new, high quality, and affordable edition of this timeless book.",

Written for himself with no intention of publishing his writing, Meditations of Marcus Aurelius documents the emperor’s attempts to attain a better understanding of himself and the world around him, detailing his struggle with his emotions, ideas of virtue, the gods, reason, and all things in between. Despite being for his own benefit, his work was to become one of the most important works of philosophy, inspiring intellectuals, statesmen, and teachers for thousands of years. Marcus Aurelius was Roman Emperor from 161 to 180. The last of the Five Good Emperors, he is hailed as one of the greatest Stoic philosophers. This fascinating philosophical work is published now with a new introductory biography of the author.",

    "description": "Plato's Republic is widely acknowledged as the cornerstone of Western philosophy. Presented in the form of a dialogue between Socrates and three different interlocutors, it is an enquiry into the notion of a perfect community and the ideal individual within it. During the conversation other questions are raised: what is goodness; what is reality; what is knowledge? The Republic also addresses the purpose of education and the role of both women and men as 'guardians' of the people. With remarkable lucidity and deft use of allegory, Plato arrives at a depiction of a state bound by harmony and ruled by 'philosopher kings'.",

O diálogo, conduzido por Sócrates, investiga a natureza da justiça. Platão propõe uma sociedade ideal, composta por três classes: Produtores (agricultores, artesãos, comerciantes) Guardiões (soldados) Governantes (filósofos-reis) Ele defende que a justiça ocorre quando cada classe desempenha sua função adequada. Os filósofos-reis, por sua sabedoria, devem governar a sociedade. A obra apresenta a Alegoria da Caverna, simbolizando a busca pela verdade e conhecimento. Prisioneiros na caverna só veem sombras, até que um é libertado e descobre a luz do sol. Essa metáfora ilustra a jornada filosófica para alcançar a realidade e a verdade. A República aborda temas como ética, política, e a alma humana. Continua sendo uma obra fundamental, estudada e debatida por filósofos e acadêmicos.",

The dramatic date of the dialogue has been much debated and though it must take place some time during the Peloponnesian War, \"there would be jarring anachronisms if any of the candidate specific dates between 432 and 404 were assigned\". It is Plato's best-known work and has proven to be one of the most intellectually and historically influential works of philosophy and political theory. In it, Socrates along with various Athenians and foreigners discuss the meaning of justice and examine whether or not the just man is happier than the unjust man by considering a series of different cities coming into existence \"in speech\", culminating in a city (Kallipolis) ruled by philosopher-kings; and by examining the nature of existing regimes. The participants also discuss the theory of forms, the immortality of the soul, and the roles of the philosopher and of poetry in society.",

This collection of essays, written by both senior and younger scholars in the field, presents a thorough and close examination of the work. The essays address a broad range of issues including the compositional integrity of the Ethics, the nature of desire, the value of emotions, happiness and the virtues. The result is a volume which will challenge and advance the scholarship on the Ethics, establishing new ways of viewing and appreciating the work for all scholars of Aristotle.",

    "description": "The Nicomachean Ethics is one of Aristotle’s most widely read and influential works. Ideas central to ethics—that happiness is the end of human endeavor, that moral virtue is formed through action and habituation, and that good action requires prudence—found their most powerful proponent in the person medieval scholars simply called “the Philosopher.” Drawing on their intimate knowledge of Aristotle’s thought, Robert C. Bartlett and Susan D. Collins have produced here an English-language translation of the Ethics that is as remarkably faithful to the original as it is graceful in its rendering. Aristotle is well known for the precision with which he chooses his words, and in this elegant translation his work has found its ideal match. Bartlett and Collins provide copious notes and a glossary providing context and further explanation for students, as well as an introduction and a substantial interpretive essay that sketch central arguments of the work and the seminal place of Aristotle’s Ethics in his political philosophy as a whole. The Nicomachean Ethics has engaged the serious interest of readers across centuries and civilizations—of peoples ancient, medieval, and modern; pagan, Christian, Muslim, and Jewish—and this new edition will take its place as the standard English-language translation.",

It is soundly located within a philosophical tradition, but its argument differs markedly from those of Plato and Socrates in its emphasis on the exercise - as opposed to the mere possession - of virtue as the key to human happiness, offering seminal discussions of ethical issues that are practical in their intent. Topics covered include the role of luck in human wellbeing, moral education, responsibility, courage, justice, moral weakness, friendship and pleasure. This accessible new translation by Roger Crisp follows the Greek text closely and also provides a non-Greek-reader with the flavour of the original. The volume also includes a historical and philosophical introduction and notes on further reading.",

Like Thus Spoke Zarathustra, which had immediately preceded it, Beyond Good and Evil represents Nietzsche's attempt to sum up his philosophy—but in less flamboyant and more systematic form. The nine parts of the book are designed to give the reader a comprehensive idea of Nietzsche’s thought and style: they span \"The Prejudices of Philosophers,\" \"The Free Spirit,\" religion, morals, scholarship, \"Our Virtues,\" \"Peoples and Fatherlands,\" and \"What is Noble,\" as well as chapter of epigrams and a concluding poem. This translation by Walter Kaufmann—the first ever to be made in English by a philosopher—has become the standard one, for accuracy and fidelity to the eccentricities and grace of style of the original. Unlike other editions, in English or German, this volume offers an inclusive index of subjects and persons referred to in the book. Professor Kaufmann, the distinguished Nietzsche scholar, has also provided a running footnote commentary on the text.",

Is there not ground for suspecting that all philosophers, in so far as they have been dogmatists, have failed to understand women—that the terrible seriousness and clumsy importunity with which they have usually paid their addresses to Truth, have been unskilled and unseemly methods for winning a woman? Certainly she has never allowed herself to be won; and at present every kind of dogma stands with sad and discouraged mien—If, indeed, it stands at all! For there are scoffers who maintain that it has fallen, that all dogma lies on the ground—nay more, that it is at its last gasp. But to speak seriously, there are good grounds for hoping that all dogmatizing in philosophy, whatever solemn, whatever conclusive and decided airs it has assumed, may have been only a noble puerilism and tyronism; and probably the time is at hand when it will be once and again understood what has actually sufficed for the basis of such imposing and absolute philosophical edifices as the dogmatists have hitherto reared: perhaps some popular superstition of immemorial time (such as the soul-superstition, which, in the form of subject- and ego-superstition, has not yet ceased doing mischief): perhaps some play upon words, a deception on the part of grammar",

    "description": "A deluxe, high-quality edition of Friedrich Nietzsche’s seminal work Beyond Good and Evil is one of the final books by German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. This landmark work continues to be one of the most well-known and influential explorations of moral and ethical philosophy ever conceived. Expanding on the concepts from his previous work Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Nietzsche adopts a polemic approach to past philosophers who, in his view, lacked critical sense in accepting flawed premises in their consideration of morality. The metaphysics of morality, Nietzsche argues, should not assume that a good man is simply the opposite of an evil man, rather merely different expression of humanity’s common basic impulses. Controversial in its time, as well as hotly debated in the present, Nietzsche’s work moves beyond conventional ethics to suggest that a universal morality for all human beings in non-existent – perception, reason and experience are not static, but change according to an individual’s perspective and interpretation. The work further argues that philosophic traditions such as “truth,” “self-consciousness” and “free will” are merely inventions of Western morality and that the “will to power” is the real driving force of all human behaviour. This volume: Critiques the belief that actions, including domination or injury to the weak, can be universally objectionable Explores themes of religion and “master and slave” morality Includes a collection of stunning aphorisms and observations of the human condition Part of the bestselling Capstone Classics Series edited by Tom Butler-Bowdon,this collectible, hard-back edition of Beyond Good and Evil provides an accessible and insightful Introduction by leading Nietzsche authority Dr Christopher Janaway.

    "description": "No philosopher could be a better example of creative thinking in action than Friedrich Nietzsche: a German iconoclast who systematically attacked the traditionally accepted views of academic philosophers, seeking to tear down their rickety platform and replace it with a platform of his own. Creative thinkers are people who redefine issues and topics in novel ways to create novel connections, explanations and hypotheses – people, in short, who can turn a topic on its head and present it in an entirely new light. Nietzsche called them “free spirits” – those unwilling to accept the dogmas of the past, wanting instead to think clearly for themselves. In Beyond Good and Evil, Nietzsche focuses his attention on nothing less than the underlying basis of our moral assumptions, unleashing a powerful, polemical critique of the moral dogmas of the past and his own time. His book, which remains one of the most influential works of moral philosophy ever written, is not just an example of creative thinking at work, it is also a passionate argument for its importance. As Nietzsche wrote, “Morality in Europe ... is the morality of herd animals.” But if one is ready to think differently and stand out from the herd, “other (and especially higher) moralities are ... possible.”",

Nineteenth-century Europe was for him a moral wasteland filled with false altruism, duplicity, double standards, and, worst of all, moral complacency. Nietzsche shocked his readers to the core by openly speaking their innermost thoughts: morality serves the social good, which for him meant fostering the best possible society - one that strives for excellence and abhors the herd mentality. By rejecting the \"standards\" of contemporary morality, Nietzsche thought, one stood a chance of going beyond good and evil to a community in which superior moral agents who understand human nature would rise above vacuous egalitarianism and the dominant schools of ethical theory to construct a moral aristocracy that would spearhead a new social renaissance. Nietzsche is at once unsettling, compelling, and provocative.",

    "description": "`What is done out of love always takes place beyond good and evil.' Always provocative, the Friedrich Nietzsche of Beyond Good and Evil (1886) is at once sceptical psychologist and philosopher-seer, passionately unmasking European society with his piercing insights and uncanny prescience. This masterpiece of his maturity considers quintessential Nietzschean topics such as the origins and nature of Judeo-Christian morality; the end of philosophical dogmatism and beginning of perspectivism; the questionable virtues of science and scholarship; liberal democracy, nationalism, and women's emancipation. Written in his most masterful style, full of irreverence and brio, Nietzsche dissects self-deluding human behaviour, bankrupt intellectual traditions, and the symptoms of social decadence, while at the same time advancing an extra-moral wisdom to be shared by those kindred soul who think 'beyond good and evil'. This new translation of Beyond Good and Evil provides readers with a true classic of modernity that sums up those forces and counterforces in nineteenth-century Western Civilisation that to an astonishing degree have also determined and continue to inform the course of our own century. ABOUT THE SERIES: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the widest range of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, helpful notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.",

    "description": "Beyond Good and Evil: Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future (German: Jenseits von Gut und Böse: Vorspiel einer Philosophie der Zukunft) is a book by philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, first published in 1886. It draws on and expands the ideas of his previous work, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, but with a more critical and polemical approach. In Beyond Good and Evil, Nietzsche accuses past philosophers of lacking critical sense and blindly accepting dogmatic premises in their consideration of morality. Specifically, he accuses them of founding grand metaphysical systems upon the faith that the good man is the opposite of the evil man, rather than just a different expression of the same basic impulses that find more direct expression in the evil man. The work moves into the realm \"beyond good and evil\" in the sense of leaving behind the traditional morality which Nietzsche subjects to a destructive critique in favour of what he regards as an affirmative approach that fearlessly confronts the perspectival nature of knowledge and the perilous condition of the modern individual.",

    "description": "The Critique of Pure Reason Immanuel Kant - 'The purpose of this critique of pure speculative reason consists in the attempt to change the old procedure of metaphysics and to bring about a complete revolution'Kant's Critique of Pure Reason (1781) is the central text of modern philosophy. It presents a profound and challenging investigation into the nature of human reason, its knowledge and its illusions. Reason, Kant argues, is the seat of certain concepts that precede experience and make it possible, but we are not therefore entitled to draw conclusions about the natural world from these concepts. The Critique brings together the two opposing schools of philosophy: rationalism, which grounds all our knowledge in reason, and empiricism, which traces all our knowledge to experience. Kant's transcendental idealism indicates a third way that goes far beyond these alternatives.",

    "description": "Metaphysicians have for centuries attempted to clarify the nature of the world and how rational human beings construct their ideas of it. Materialists believed that the world (including its human component) consisted of objective matter, an irreducible substance to which qualities and characteristics could be attributed. Mindthoughts, ideas, and perceptionswas viewed as a more sophisticated material substance. Idealists, on the other hand, argued that the world acquired its reality from mind, which breathed metaphysical life into substances that had no independent existence of their own. These two camps seemed deadlocked until Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason endeavored to show that the most accurate theory of reality would be one that combined relevant aspects of each position, yet transcended both to arrive at a more fundamental metaphysical theory. Kant's synthesis sought to disclose how human reason goes about constructing its experience of the world, thus intertwining objective simuli with rational processes that arrive at an orderly view of nature.",

    "description": "The Critique of Practical Reason Immanuel Kant - The second of Kant's three critiques, Critique of Practical Reason forms the center of Kantian philosophy; published in 1788, it is bookended by his Critique of Pure Reason and Critique of Judgement. With this work Kant establishes his role as a vindicator of the truth of Christianity; he approaches his proof by presenting positive affirmation of the immortality of the soul and the existence of God. The philosopher offers an argument concerning the summum bonum of life: people should not simply search after happiness, but follow the moral law and seek to become worthy of the happiness that God can bestow.This Critique comprises three sections: the Analytic, the Dialectic, and the Doctrine of Method. The Analytic defines the ultimate moral principle, the categorical imperative, and argues that to obey it is to exercise a freedom. The Dialectic make the assumption that immortality and God exist, arguing that pure practical reason falls into error when it expects perfection in this world; we should anticipate finding perfection in the next world, with God's help. The final section, the Doctrine of Method, offers suggestions in educating people in the use of pure practical reason.A seminal text in the history of moral philosophy, this volume offers the most complete statement of Kant's theory of free will and a full development of his practical metaphysics.",

    "description": "Originally published in 1929. PREFACE: THE present translation was begun in 1913, when I was completing my Commentary to Kants Critique of Pure Reason Owing, however, to various causes, I was unable at that time to do more than prepare a rough translation of about a third of the whole and it was not until 1927 that I found leisure to revise and continue it. In this task I have greatly profited by the work of my two predecessors, J. M. D. Meiklejohn and Max Muller. Meiklejohn's work, a translation of the second edition of the Critique was published in 1855. Max Mullers translation, which is based on the first edition of the Critique, with the second edition passages in appendices, was published in 1881. Meiklejohn has a happy gift which only those who attempt to follow in his steps can, I think, fully appreciate of making Kant speak in language that reasonably approximates to English idiom. Max Mullers main merit, as he has very justly claimed, is his greater accuracy in rendering passages in which a specially exact appreciation of the niceties of German idiom happens to be important for the sense. Both Meiklejohn and Max Muller laboured, however, under the disadvantage of not having made any very thorough study of the Critical Philosophy and the shortcomings in their translations can usually be traced to this cause. In the past fifty years, also, much has been done in the study and interpretation of the text. In particular, my task has been facilitated by the quite invaluable edition of the Critique edited by Dr. Raymund Schmidt. Indeed, the appearance of this edition in 1926 was the immediate occasion of my resuming the work of translation. Dr. Schmidts restoration of the original texts of the first and second editions of the Critique, and especially of Kants own punctuation so very helpful in many difficult and doubtful passages and his citation of alternative readings, have largely relieved me of the time-consuming task of collating texts, and of assembling the emendations suggested by Kantian scholars in their editions of the Critique or in their writings upon it. The text which I have followed is that of the second edition (1787) and I have in all cases indicated any departure from it. I have also given a translation of all first edition passages which in the second edition have been either altered or omitted. Wherever possible, this original first edition text is given in the lower part of the page. In the two sections, however, which Kant completely recast in the second edition The Transcendental Deduction of the Categories and The Paralogisms of Pure Reason this cannot conveniently be done and I have therefore given the two versions in immediate succession, in the main text. For this somewhat unusual procedure there is a twofold justification first, that the Critique is already, in itself, a composite work, the different parts of which record the successive stages in the development of Kants views and secondly, that the first edition versions are, as a matter of fact, indispensable for an adequate under standing of the versions which were substituted for them. The paging's of both the first and the second edition are given throughout, on the margins the first edition being referred to as A, the second edition as B.",

    "description": "A new 2024 translation of Martin Heidegger's major work \"Being and Time\" (Sein und Zeit), originally published in 1927 in multiple publications. This edition contains a new afterword by the Translator, a timeline of Heidegger's life and works, a philosophic index of core Heideggerian concepts and a guide for terminology across 19th and 20th century Existentialists. This translation is designed for readability and accessibility to Heidegger's enigmatic and dense philosophy. Complex and specific philosophic terms are translated as literally as possible and academic footnotes have been removed to ensure easy reading. Being and Time presents a complex philosophical discourse on the nature of being (Sein) and time (Zeit), focusing in particular on the temporal-existentialist concept of Dasein, a term that combines the German words for \"to be\" (sein) and \"there\" (da). This classic philosophic work examines the traditional metaphysical understanding of being, arguing that this understanding, typically based on the idea of a constant presence, fails to account for the temporal and existential dimensions of being. Heidegger proposes that an understanding of being requires an analysis of Dasein, which is characterized not only by its existence, but also by its being in the world and its temporal existence. The concept of Dasein is central to the his argument, emphasizing that Dasein is always already situated in a world, and its understanding of being is shaped by its temporal existence. This perspective challenges traditional metaphysical notions of being as static and unchanging, proposing instead that being is fundamentally temporal and connected to human existence and understanding. As the title suggests, Heidegger sees the question of Being as indistinguishable from Time, arguing that Newtonian conceptions of time as a series of now-points are inadequate for understanding the being of Dasein. His Ontochronology argues that the existential and ontological analysis of Dasein reveals a more fundamental concept of time, one that is integral to the structure of Being itself. The text further elaborates on the idea of \"thrownness\" and several other existentialist themes. Thrownness is one of the three conditions that signifies Dasein's immersion in the world, where it finds itself already entangled in a web of relations and meanings. This \"thrownness\", combined with Dasein's inherent being-toward-death, underscores the existential condition of human beings, framing their existence as a continual engagement with their own finitude and the possibilities of their being. Heidegger posits that understanding the nature of being requires a fundamental rethinking of both being and time, dogmatically stating that the true nature of being can only be grasped through an understanding of the temporality that characterizes the existence of being.",

    "description": "The Concept of Time presents Heidegger's so-called Dilthey review, widely considered the first draft of his celebrated masterpiece, Being and Time. Here Heidegger reveals his deep commitment to Wilhelm Dilthey and Count Yorck von Wartenburg. He agrees with them that historicity must be at the centre of the new philosophy to come. However, he also argues for an ontological approach to history. From this ontological turn he develops the so-called categories of Dasein. This work demonstrates Heidegger's indebtedness to Yorck and Dilthey and gives further evidence to the view that thought about history is the germ cell of Being and Time. However, it also shows that Heidegger's commitment to Dilthey was not without reservations and that his analysis of Dasein actually employs Husserl's phenomenology. The work reopens the question of history in a broader sense, as Heidegger struggles to thematize history without aligning it with world-historical events. The text also provides a concise and readable summary of the main themes of Being and Time and as such is an ideal companion to that text.",

In these lectures, delivered in 1933-1934 while he was Rector of the University of Freiburg and an active supporter of the National Socialist regime, Martin Heidegger addresses the history of metaphysics and the notion of truth from Heraclitus to Hegel. First published in German in 2001, these two lecture courses offer a sustained encounter with Heidegger’s thinking during a period when he attempted to give expression to his highest ambitions for a philosophy engaged with politics and the world. While the lectures are strongly nationalistic, they also attack theories of racial supremacy in an attempt to stake out a distinctively Heideggerian understanding of what it means to be a people. This careful translation offers valuable insight into Heidegger’s views on language, truth, animality, and life, as well as his political thought and activity.",

    "description": "The most prestigious and influential book on strategy and dealing with conflict, beautifully translated for clear, accessible reading. In the words of Sun Tzu, \"To win without fighting is best.\" This timeless Chinese classic captures the essence of military strategy used in ancient East Asia, with lessons on how to handle conflict confidently, efficiently, and successfully. The techniques and instructions discussed in The Art of War apply to competition and conflict on every level, from the interpersonal to the international. Its aim is invincibility, victory without battle, and unassailable strength through an understanding of the physics, politics, and psychology of conflict. Thomas Cleary's translation is a breakthrough achievement that has been a gold standard among translations for three decades, offering the complete text in eminently readable prose with short commentaries by other ancient Chinese strategists and philosophers interwoven throughout.",

Sun Tzu was a Chinese general, military strategist, and philosopher who lived in the Spring and Autumn period of ancient China. Sun Tzu is traditionally credited as the author of The Art of War, a widely influential work of military strategy that has affected both Western and Eastern philosophy. Aside from his legacy as the author of The Art of War, Sun Tzu is revered in Chinese and the Culture of Asia as a legendary historical figure. His birth name was Sun Wu, and he was known outside of his family by his courtesy name Changqing. The name Sun Tzu by which he is best known in the West is an honorific which means \"Master Sun\".",

The profound insights of this book have endured for over two thousand years, and they continue to reward careful study. The Military Methods of Sun Pin, the great-grandson of Sun Tzu, is a brilliant elaboration on his ancestor's work, which has been lost for nearly two millennia. Presented here together for the first time are the greatest of the ancient Chinese classics of strategic thought: The Complete Art of War.The Sun family writings on strategy represent a unique contribution to our understanding of human affairs. By unveiling the complex, often unexpected, interrelationships of armies locked in battle, their wisdom reveals the enduring principles of success in the struggle of life itself. With a unique index to the essential principles of strategy, and Sawyer's thoughtful chapter-by-chapter commentaries, The Complete Art of War is designed to guide the reader to new insights into the nature of human conflict and a greater understanding of every field of human activity, from playing the game of politics to building a successful marriage, from closing a deal to managing a large organization, and even from making war to making peace.",

Composed of 13 chapters, each of which is devoted to one aspect of warfare, it has long been praised as the definitive work on military strategies and tactics of its time. The Art of War is one of the oldest books on military strategy in the world. It is the first and one of the most successful works on strategy and has had a huge influence on Eastern and Western military thinking, business tactics, and beyond. Sun Tzu was the first to recognize the importance of positioning in strategy and that position is affected both by objective conditions in the physical environment and the subjective opinions of competitive actors in that environment. He taught that strategy was not planning in the sense of working through a to-do list, but rather that it requires quick and appropriate responses to changing conditions. Planning works in a controlled environment, but in a competitive environment,",

    "description": "'A prince must not have any other object nor any other thought...but war, its institutions, and its discipline; because that is the only art befitting one who commands.' When Machiavelli's brief treatise on Renaissance statecraft and princely power was posthumously published in 1532, it generated a debate that has raged unabated until the present day. Based upon Machiavelli's first-hand experience as an emissary of the Florentine Republic to the courts of Europe, The Prince analyses the usually violent means by which men seize, retain, and lose political power. Machiavelli added a dimension of incisive realism to one of the major philosophical and political issues of his time, especially the relationship between public deeds and private morality. His book provides a remarkably uncompromising picture of the true nature of power, no matter in what era or by whom it is exercised. This fluent new translation is accompanied by comprehensive notes and an introduction that considers the true purpose of The Prince and dispels some of the myths associated with it. ABOUT THE SERIES: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the widest range of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, helpful notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.",

Although it was written as if it were a traditional work in the \"mirrors for princes\" style, it is generally agreed that it was especially innovative. This is only partly because it was written in the vernacular Italian rather than Latin, a practice which had become increasingly popular since the publication of Dante's \"Divine Comedy\" and other works of Renaissance literature. \"The Prince\" is sometimes claimed to be one of the first works of modern philosophy, especially modern political philosophy, in which the effective truth is taken to be more important than any abstract ideal.

Si tratta senza dubbio della sua opera più nota e celebrata, quella dalle cui massime (spesso superficialmente interpretate) sono nati il sostantivo \"machiavellismo\" e l'aggettivo \"machiavellico\". L'opera non è ascrivibile ad alcun genere letterario particolare, in quanto non ha le caratteristiche di un vero e proprio trattato; se ne è ipotizzata la natura di libriccino a carattere divulgativo. \"Il Principe\" si compone di una dedica e ventisei capitoli di varia lunghezza; l'ultimo capitolo consiste nell'appello ai de' Medici ad accettare le tesi espresse nel testo.",

Niccolò Machiavelli asserted that The Prince (president, dictator, prime minister, etc.) does not have to be concerned with ethics, as long as their motivation is to protect the state. It is this questionable belief that in many ways had lead to the modern world as we know it. His assertion was that the head of state must protect the state no matter the cost and no matter what rules he or she breaks in the process._x000D_",

    "description": "In The Social Contract, Rousseau wrote one of the most influential studies ever made. It is as relevant today as when it was first published more than 250 years ago. Political society, Rousseau argued, required each individual to submit their personal desires to the 'general will'. At the same time, there was no 'divine right' of the monarchy to allow them to act as they pleased. Therefore, there must be a social contract between governor and governed - the only truly legitimate form of government. Rousseau's ideas influenced both the French and American Revolutions and created the foundations of the liberal democratic societies we live in today.",

His masterpiece, The Social Contract, profoundly influenced the subsequent development of society and remains provocative in a modern age of continuing widespread vested interest.

Volume II contains the later writings such as The Social Contract and a selection of Rousseau's letters on important aspects of his thought. The Social Contract has become Rousseau's most famous single work, but on publication was condemned by both the civil and the ecclesiastical authorities in France and Geneva. Rousseau fled and it is during this period that he wrote some of his autobiographical works as well as political essays such as On the Government of Poland.

    "description": "For nearly two generations, this translation of the Tao Te Ching has been the standard for those seeking access to the wisdom of Taoist thought. Now Jane English and her long-time editor, Toinette Lippe, have refreshed and revised the translation, so that it more faithfully reflects the Classical Chinese in which it was first written, while taking into account changes in our own language and eliminating any lingering infelicities. Lao Tsu’s philosophy is simple: Accept what is in front of you without wanting the situation to be other than it is. Study the natural order of things and work with it rather than against it, for to try to change what is only sets up resistance. Nature provides everything without requiring payment or thanks. It does so without discrimination. So let us present the same face to everyone and treat them all as equals, however they may behave. If we watch carefully, we will see that work proceeds more quickly and easily if we stop “trying,” if we stop putting in so much extra effort, if we stop looking for results. In the clarity of a still and open mind, truth will be reflected. Te—which may be translated as “virtue” or “strength”—lies always in Tao meaning “the way” or “natural law.” In other words: Simply be.",

    "description": "The enduring wisdom of the Tao Te Ching can become a companion for your own spiritual journey. Reportedly written by a sage named Lao Tzu over 2,500 years ago, the Tao Te Ching is one of the most succinct--and yet among the most profound--spiritual texts ever written. Short enough to read in an afternoon, subtle enough to study for a lifetime, the Tao Te Ching distills into razor-sharp poetry centuries of spiritual inquiry into the Tao--the \"Way\" of the natural world around us that reveals the ultimate organizing principle of the universe. Derek Lin's insightful commentary, along with his new translation from the original Chinese--a translation that sets a whole new standard for accuracy--will inspire your spiritual journey and enrich your everyday life. It highlights the Tao Te Ching's insights on simplicity, balance, and learning from the paradoxical truths you can see all around you: finding strength through flexibility (because bamboo bends, it is tough to break); achieving goals by transcending obstacles (water simply flows around rocks on its way to the sea); believing that small changes bring powerful results (a sapling, in time, grows into a towering tree). Now you can experience the wisdom and power of Lao Tzu's words even if you have no previous knowledge of the Tao Te Ching. SkyLight Illuminations provides insightful yet unobtrusive commentary that describes helpful historical background, explains the Tao Te Ching's poetic imagery, and elucidates the ancient Taoist wisdom that will speak to your life today and energize your spiritual quest.",

Through aphorisms and parable, it leads readers toward the Tao, or the “Way”: harmony with the life force of the universe. Traditionally attributed to Lao-tzu, a Chinese philosopher thought to have been a contemporary of Confucius, it is the essential text of Taoism, one of the three major religions of ancient China. As one of the world’s great works of wisdom literature, it still has much to teach us today, offering a practical model based on modesty and self-restraint for living a balanced existence and for opening your mind, freeing your thoughts, and attaining greater self-awareness. With its emphasis on calm, simplicity, purity, and non-action, it provides a time-tested refuge from the busyness of modern life. This new translation seeks to understand the Tao Te Ching as a guide to everyday living and encourages a slow, meditative reading experience. The Tao Te Ching’s eighty-one brief chapters are accompanied by illuminating commentary, interpretation, poems, and testimonials by the likes of Margaret Mead, Ursula K. Le Guin, and Dr. Wayne W. Dyer. Specially commissioned calligraphy for more than two hundred Chinese characters illustrates the book’s essential themes.",

    "description": "\"Lao Tzu. 'Tao Te Ching' stands as an ancient philosophical masterpiece, encapsulating the wisdom of Taoism. This foundational text, believed to have been written in the 6th century BCE, offers profound insights into the nature of existence, the principles of harmony, and the art of virtuous living. Comprising 81 verses, 'Tao Te Ching' explores the concept of Tao, the unnameable and ineffable force that underlies and unites all aspects of the universe. Lao Tzu imparts timeless teachings on the virtue of simplicity, the power of yielding, and the importance of aligning with the natural order. The verses delve into the duality of Yin and Yang, emphasizing balance and the interconnectedness of opposites. Lao Tzu advocates for a harmonious way of life, rooted in humility, compassion, and non-action (Wu Wei). He presents the idea that true wisdom lies in embracing the ebb and flow of life without undue interference. This enduring classic challenges conventional thinking and invites readers to contemplate the essence of existence, urging them to align with the Tao to attain a state of inner peace and enlightenment. 'Tao Te Ching' continues to be a source of inspiration for those seeking spiritual guidance, ethical principles, and a deeper understanding of the universal flow of existence.",

At a party near the Bennets’ home in the English countryside, Elizabeth meets the wealthy, proud Fitzwilliam Darcy. Elizabeth initially finds Darcy haughty and intolerable, but circumstances continue to unite the pair. Mr. Darcy finds himself captivated by Elizabeth’s wit and candor, while her reservations about his character slowly vanish. The story is as much a social critique as it is a love story, and the prose crackles with Austen’s wry wit.",

A despeito dos cenários antigos descritos no livro, o leitor se deparará com um mundo moderno, pois, por detrás de todas as pompas, ritos sociais e regras de etiqueta muito comuns à época, mora soberana, na obra de Austen, a crítica ao caráter humano, sempre diversificado e atemporal. A autora, além de documentar o convívio das pessoas de sua época, denota, através de sua prosa, um controle imenso do humor e da ironia - figura de linguagem que exerce total influência de sua obra - e delata a hipocrisia, a superficialidade e os estereótipos que até hoje se mantém em voga em nossa sociedade.",

The story follows the main character Elizabeth Bennet as she deals with issues of manners, upbringing, morality, education, and marriage in the society of the landed gentry of early 19th-century England. Elizabeth is the second of five daughters of a country gentleman living near the fictional town of Meryton in Hertfordshire, near London. Though the story is set at the turn of the 19th century, it retains a fascination for modern readers, continuing near the top of lists of \"most loved books\" such as The Big Read. It has become one of the most popular novels in English literature and receives considerable attention from literary scholars. Modern interest in the book has resulted in a number of dramatic adaptations and an abundance of novels and stories imitating Austen's memorable characters or themes. To date, the book has sold some 20 million copies worldwide. As Anna Quindlen wrote, Pride and Prejudice is also about that thing that all great novels consider, the search for self. And it is the first great novel that teaches us this search is as surely undertaken in the drawing room making small talk as in the pursuit of a great white whale or the public punishment of adultery.",

Elizabeth is the second of five daughters of a country gentleman living near the fictional town of Meryton in Hertfordshire, near London. Page 2 of a letter from Jane Austen to her sister Cassandra (11 June 1799) in which she first mentions Pride and Prejudice, using its working title First Impressions.

While Bingley takes an immediate liking to the eldest Bennet daughter, Jane, Darcy has difficulty adapting to local society and repeatedly clashes with the second-eldest Bennet daughter, Elizabeth.

    "description": "his perfect indifference, and your pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd!' Pride and Prejudice has delighted generations of readers with its unforgettable cast of characters, carefully choreographed plot, and a hugely entertaining view of the world and its absurdities. With the arrival of eligible young men in their neighbourhood, the lives of Mr and Mrs Bennet and their five daughters are turned inside out and menide down. Pride encounters prejudice, upward-mobility confronts social disdain, and quick-wittedness challenges sagacity, as misconceptions and hasty judgements lead to heartache and scandal, but eventually to true understanding, self-knowledge, and love. In this supremely satisfying story, Jane Austen balances comedy with seriousness, and witty observation with profound insight. If Elizabeth Bennet returns again and again to her letter from Mr Darcy, readers of the novel are drawn even more irresistibly by its captivating wisdom. ABOUT THE SERIES: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the widest range of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, helpful notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.",

O foco está na perda gradual da sensibilidade moral e espiritual de Jane, e todos os eventos são relatados com uma crescente intensidade que até o surgimento deste livro era do domínio exclusivo da poesia. O romance contém elementos de crítica social, com um forte senso de moral cristã no seu núcleo, é, no entanto, uma novela que muitos consideram anterior ao seu tempo, tendo em conta o caráter individualista de Jane e a exploração do romance sobre o classismo, a sexualidade, a religião e o feminismo. Jane Eyre é um daqueles clássicos imperdíveis e, merecidamente, faz parte da famosa coletânea: 1001 livros para ler antes de morrer.",

Após tornar-se órfã e, ainda na infância, passar a viver na casa da tia enfrentando as mais difíceis privações, Jane fica anos em um internato, onde recebe educação e, posteriormente, um emprego. Contrariando o que se esperava de uma mulher na época, a protagonista busca novos desafios e se torna governanta de Miss Adèle, protegida de Mr. Rochester. Entre Jane e o novo patrão nasce uma paixão arrebatadora, obscurecida, no entanto, por um grave segredo que ele carrega.

Its representation of the underside of domestic life and the hypocrisy behind religious enthusiasm drew both praise and bitter criticism, while Charlotte Brontë’s striking exposé of poor living conditions for children in charity schools as well as her poignant portrayal of the limitations faced by women who worked as governesses sparked great controversy and social debate. Jane Eyre, Brontë’s best-known novel, remains an extraordinary coming-of-age narrative and one of the great classics of literature.

The book was initially poorly received by many critics who found its dark, tragic story needlessly harsh and disturbing. That opinion has not endured, and the only novel Emily Bronte published is now considered to be one of the great classics of English literature.",

    "description": "'I am Heathcliff - he's always, always in my mind ...' Discovered on the streets of Liverpool, Heathcliff is rescued by Mr Earnshaw and taken to the remote Yorkshire farmhouse of Wuthering Heights. Earnshaw's daughter Catherine rapidly forms a passionate attachment to him, but when Catherine's brother takes over the Heights, Heathcliff is lowered to the position of a barely-tolerated farmhand. When Catherine decides to marry the refined Edgar Linton instead, Heathcliff turns revenger. He determines to degrade not only those who sought to degrade him, but their children after them. Wuthering Heights is one of the most famous love stories in the English language. It is also, as the Introduction to this edition explores, one of the most potent revenge narratives. Its ingenious narrative structure, vivid evocation of landscape, and the extraordinary power of its depiction of love and hatred have given it a unique place in English literature. This edition reproduces the authoritative Clarendon text, with revised and expanded notes and a selection from the poems of Emily Brontë. ABOUT THE SERIES: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the widest range of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, helpful notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.",

A obra conta a história da paixão entre Heathcliff e Catherine na fazenda chamada Morro dos Ventos Uivantes. Amigos de infância, eles são separados pelo destino, mas a união do casal é mais forte do que qualquer tormenta - um amor proibido que deixará rastros de ira e vingança. \"O MORRO DOS VENTOS UIVANTES\" foi publicado em 1847 através do pseudônimo \"Ellis Bell\". Hoje considerado um dos grandes clássicos da literatura universal, caracteriza-se como uma grande história de amor amaldiçoado e de vingança, e visto como a mais intensa história de amor já escrita na língua inglesa, tendo recebido fortes críticas quando de sua publicação no século XIX.",

Berubahlah dalam bentuk apa pun yang kau sukai, lalu rasukilah diriku, biarkan aku jadi gila karenanya!\" Heathcliff tergila-gila pada Catherine Earnshaw semenjak mereka baru saling mengenal. Hanya Catherine yang dapat membuat pria dingin itu menangis dan tertawa. Namun, Catherine ternyata lebih memilih Edgar Linton, bangsawan kaya yang menjadi saingan Heathcliff selama bertahun-tahun. Semuanya karena kelas sosial Heathcliff yang rendah, yang membuatnya tak pantas bersanding dengan Catherine. Heathcliff bersumpah tidak akan mati sebelum mengobrak-abrik hidup keduanya dan merenggut harta kekayaan mereka; mansion Wuthering Heights termasuk di antaranya. Dendam membuat Heathcliff menjadi pria tamak, serakah, dan tak berperasaan. Ia bahkan lebih mengerikan dari ular, lebih berbahaya dari binatang liar. Dan, itu semua karena satu hal: cinta. Namun dapatkah cintanya mengalahkan kegelapannya? Terlebih ketika Catherine tak mungkin bisa dimilikinya lagi. Wuthering Heights adalah karya yang paling banyak dibicarakan pada era Victoria di abad ke-19. Satu-satunya karya Emily Brontë ini menjadi pelopor genre roman baru, dengan atmosfer gelap, namun elegan. Sebuah kisah klasik yang tak pernah lekang oleh masa. \"Emily Bronte mampu memporakporandakan persepsi kita tentang sifat manusia ....” —Virginia Woolf [Mizan, Classic, Sastra Klasik, Novel, Terjemahan, Indonesia]",

    "description": "Facets of Wuthering Heights is a collection of essays by one author concerned to throw critical light on several different facets of Emily Brontë’s masterpiece, Wuthering Heights. Although three of the essays deal partly with the historical background to the novel, the collection as a whole seeks to draw attention to Emily Brontë’s remarkable versatility as a novelist by, for example, implicitly pointing up the skill with which she has constructed the plot, the inventiveness with which she has created an astonishing variety of characters, and the brilliance with which she has made structural use of her central themes. This book is intended to encourage readers to take a fresh look at Wuthering Heights as a work of art which, far from deserving to be read merely for its extraordinary treatment of love, is, in fact, eminently notable for its author’s objective and dispassionate portrayal of a particular society and a particular set of individuals in late eighteenth-century England and beyond.",

    "description": "Wuthering Heights by Emily Brontë Wuthering Heights begins with Lockwood, a Heathcliff tenant, visiting his landlord's home. A subsequent visit to Wuthering Heights produces an accident and a curious supernatural encounter, which piques Lockwood's curiosity. Back at Thrushcross Grange and recovering from her illness, Lockwood begs Nelly Dean, a maid who grew up in Wuthering Heights and now worries about Thrushcross Grange, to tell her the story of Heathcliff. Nelly narrates the main plot of Wuthering Heights. Earnshaw, a Yorkshire farmer and owner of Wuthering Heights, brings home an orphan from Liverpool. The boy's name is Heathcliff and he is raised with Earnshaw's children, Hindley and Catherine. Catherine loves Heathcliff but Hindley hates him because Heathcliff has replaced Hindley in the affection of Mr. Earnshaw. After Mr. Earnshaw's death, Hindley does what he can to destroy Heathcliff, but Catherine and Heathcliff grow up playing wildly in the wastelands, unaware of anything or anyone else, until they meet the Lintons. Edgar and Isabella Linton live in Thrushcross Grange and are completely opposite from Heathcliff and Catherine. The Lintons welcome Catherine into their home, but avoid Heathcliff. Treated as an outsider once more, Heathcliff begins to think about revenge. Catherine splits her time between Heathcliff and Edgar at first, but soon spends more time with Edgar, which makes Heathcliff jealous. When Heathcliff hears Catherine tell Nelly that she will never be able to marry him (Heathcliff), he leaves Wuthering Heights and leaves for three years. While he's gone, Catherine continues to court and ends up marrying Edgar. Their happiness is short-lived because they are from two different worlds, and their relationship is further strained when Heathcliff returns. Relationships are further complicated when Heathcliff ends up living with his enemy, Hindley (and Hindley's son, Hareton), in Wuthering Heights and marries Edgar's sister Isabella. Shortly after Heathcliff's marriage, Catherine gives birth to Edgar's daughter, Cathy, and dies. Heathcliff vows revenge and doesn't care who he hurts while executing him. He wants to take control of Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange and destroy everything Edgar Linton holds dear. To get revenge, Heathcliff must wait 17 years. Eventually, he forces Cathy to marry his son, Linton. At that point he is in control of Heights and with Edgar's death, he is in control of Grange. Despite all this, however, Catherine's ghost haunts Heathcliff. What you really want more than anything else is to reunite with your soulmate. At the end of the novel, Heathcliff and Catherine are united in death, and Hareton and Cathy will be united in marriage.",

    "description": "Scarlett O'Hara was not beautiful, but men seldom realized it when caught by her charm as the Tarleton twins were. In her face were too sharply blended the delicate features of her mother, a Coast aristocrat of French descent, and the heavy ones of her florid Irish father. But it was an arresting face, pointed of chin, square of jaw. Her eyes were pale green without a touch of hazel, starred with bristly black lashes and slightly tilted at the ends. Above them, her thick black brows slanted upward, cutting a startling oblique line in her magnolia-white skin--that skin so prized by Southern women and so carefully guarded with bonnets, veils and mittens against hot Georgia suns. Seated with Stuart and Brent Tarleton in the cool shade of the porch of Tara, her father's plantation, that bright April afternoon of 1861, she made a pretty picture. Her new green flowered-muslin dress spread its twelve yards of billowing material over her hoops and exactly matched the flat-heeled green morocco slippers her father had recently brought her from Atlanta. The dress set off to perfection the seventeen-inch waist, the smallest in three counties, and the tightly fitting basque showed breasts well matured for her sixteen years. But for all the modesty of her spreading skirts, the demureness of hair netted smoothly into a chignon and the quietness of small white hands folded in her lap, her true self was poorly concealed. The green eyes in the carefully sweet face were turbulent, willful, lusty with life, distinctly at variance with her decorous demeanor. Her manners had been imposed upon her by her mother's gentle admonitions and the sterner discipline of her mammy; her eyes were her own. On either side of her, the twins lounged easily in their chairs, squinting at the sunlight through tall mint-garnished glasses as they laughed and talked, their long legs, booted to the knee and thick with saddle muscles, crossed negligently. Nineteen years old, six feet two inches tall, long of bone and hard of muscle, with sunburned faces and deep auburn hair, their eyes merry and arrogant, their bodies clothed in identical blue coats and mustard-colored breeches, they were as much alike as two bolls of cotton.",

The story is set in Clayton County and Atlanta, both in Georgia, during the American Civil War and Reconstruction Era. It depicts the struggles of young Scarlett O'Hara, the spoiled daughter of a well-to-do plantation owner, who must use every means at her disposal to claw her way out of poverty following Sherman's destructive \"March to the Sea\".Gone With the Wind is a story about civil war, starvation, rape, murder, heartbreak and slavery. It is not necessarily a book one would associate with hope. And yet, at the novel's heart lies Scarlett O'Hara, one of the most ruthlessly optimistic characters in literature.This edition is in 4 volumes.",

Lygia Fagundes Telles é considerada pela crítica uma das maiores escritoras brasileiras e, sobretudo, uma contista extraordinária. Pela primeira vez, o leitor tem acesso à mais completa antologia de contos da autora, em uma edição especial que inclui, além de suas principais coletâneas, diversos escritos esparsos, há tempos fora de catálogo. Dos primeiros contos, concebidos na juventude, até sua produção mais madura, Lygia exibe sua maestria na narrativa curta, sempre com sensibilidade e sutileza, em textos impecáveis. \"Lygia Fagundes Telles sempre teve o alto mérito de obter, no romance e no conto, a limpidez adequada a uma visão que penetra e revela, sem recurso a qualquer truque ou traço carregado, na linguagem ou na caracterização.\" — Antonio Candido \"Essas pequenas obras-primas, de tão fremente inquietação íntima e que exalam um desespero tão profundo, ganham a clássica serenidade das formas de arte definitivas.\" — Paulo Rónai",

Nacido en una antigua familia de la nobleza, sus obras constituyen un fiel reflejo de la sociedad rusa de la época, convirtiéndolo en uno de los representantes más reconocidos del realismo. En “Anna Karenina” (que empezó a publicarse como un folletín en 1875, y se publicaría por primera vez entera en 1877), Tolstói narra la relación adúltera entre Anna Karenina, casada con un alto funcionario del gobierno, y el conde Vronsky, vínculo a través del cual el escritor retrata la doble moral y los antivalores de un entorno que no sanciona con la misma dureza moral al hombre y a la mujer. Además, muestra la profunda desigualdad social entre la élite y el campesinado, y la búsqueda de la felicidad del ser humano, que alcanza tras una metamorfosis espiritual. La novela ha sido llevada al cine en más de diez adaptaciones, y también sido adaptada a producciones teatrales y ópera.",

Die Dame des Hauses hatte in Erfahrung gebracht, daß ihr Gatte mit der im Hause gewesenen französischen Gouvernante ein Verhältnis unterhalten, und ihm erklärt, sie könne fürderhin nicht mehr mit ihm unter einem Dache bleiben. Diese Situation währte bereits seit drei Tagen und sie wurde nicht allein von den beiden Ehegatten selbst, nein auch von allen Familienmitgliedern und dem Personal aufs Peinlichste empfunden. Sie alle fühlten, daß in ihrem Zusammenleben kein höherer Gedanke mehr liege, daß die Leute, welche auf jeder Poststation sich zufällig träfen, noch enger zu einander gehörten, als sie, die Glieder der Familie selbst, und das im Hause geborene und aufgewachsene Gesinde der Oblonskiy. Die Herrin des Hauses verließ ihre Gemächer nicht, der Gebieter war schon seit drei Tagen abwesend. Die Kinder liefen wie verwaist im ganzen Hause umher, die Engländerin schalt auf die Wirtschafterin und schrieb an eine Freundin, diese möchte ihr eine neue Stellung verschaffen, der Koch hatte bereits seit gestern um die Mittagszeit das Haus verlassen und die Köchin, sowie der Kutscher hatten ihre Rechnungen eingereicht. Am dritten Tage nach der Scene erwachte der Fürst Stefan Arkadjewitsch Oblonskiy — Stiwa hieß er in der Welt — um die gewöhnliche Stunde, das heißt um acht Uhr morgens, aber nicht im Schlafzimmer seiner Gattin, sondern in seinem Kabinett auf dem Saffiandiwan. Er wandte seinen vollen verweichlichten Leib auf den Sprungfedern des Diwans, als wünsche er noch weiter zu schlafen, während er von der andern Seite innig ein Kissen umfaßte und an die Wange drückte. Plötzlich aber sprang er empor, setzte sich aufrecht und öffnete die Augen.",

Parrebbe avveduta e serena, ma - quando incontra il passionale conte Vronskij - s'innamora perdutamente, tanto da abbandonare per lui l'influente marito e il figlio. La società si oppone all'illecita relazione e Anna, sempre più logorata da gelosia e amarezza, soccombe a una fine annunciata. La sua storia s'intreccia a quella di Levin, portavoce di un profondo amore per la Russia rurale, contrapposta all'ozio e ai vizi della società urbana europeizzata. Se Anna è un'icona intramontabile della letteratura universale, Levin è un carismatico interprete dei grandi quesiti etici della letteratura russa. Un capolavoro insuperato qui proposto nella nuova traduzione di una tra i più autorevoli slavisti italiani.",

    "description": "Dieses eBook: \"Anna Karenina\" ist mit einem detaillierten und dynamischen Inhaltsverzeichnis versehen und wurde sorgfältig korrekturgelesen. Dieses eBook präsentiert die klassische Übersetzung von Hans Moser. Anna Karenina ist ein Roman von Leo Tolstoi, der in den Jahren 1873 bis 1878 in der Epoche des russischen Realismus entstand und als eines von Tolstois besten Werken gilt. Das Buch wurde 1877/78 veröffentlicht und handelt von Ehe und Moral in der adligen russischen Gesellschaft des 19. Jahrhunderts. Das Romanepos verwebt die Geschichten dreier adliger Familien: des Fürsten Stepan Oblonski und seiner Frau Dolly, Dollys jüngere Schwester Kitty Schtscherbazkaja und des Gutsbesitzers Ljewin, sowie schließlich das Schicksal Anna Kareninas, der Schwester des Fürsten, die mit dem Staatsbeamten Alexej Karenin verheiratet ist. Der Roman steht thematisch (Ehe/Ehebruch) neben anderen bedeutsamen realistischen Romanen in Europa, was zeigt, wie wichtig das Sujet in dieser Zeit war. Madame Bovary von Gustave Flaubert, Effi Briest und L'Adultera von Theodor Fontane können in der Epoche des Realismus für diese Art des \"Verführungsromans\" am Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts zum Vergleich herangezogen werden. Unter Tolstois Romanen gilt Anna Karenina als künstlerisch vollkommenster, der die moralischen Werte und Anschauungen des russischen Schriftstellers breitgefächert präsentiert. Lew Nikolajewitsch Graf Tolstoi, häufig auch Leo Tolstoi oder Lew Tolstoi, war ein russischer Schriftsteller. Seine Hauptwerke Krieg und Frieden und Anna Karenina sind Klassiker des realistischen Romans.",

    "description": "Widely considered a pinnacle in realist fiction, Tolstoy considered Anna Karenina his first real novel and Dostoevsky declared it to be \"flawless as a work of art\". His opinion was shared by Vladimir Nabokov, who especially admired \"the flawless magic of Tolstoy's style\", and by William Faulkner, who described the novel as \"the best ever written\". The novel is currently enjoying enormous popularity, as demonstrated by a recent poll of 125 contemporary authors by J. Peder Zane, published in 2007 in The Top Ten, which declared that Anna Karenina is the \"greatest novel ever written\". Plot: A bachelor, Vronsky is willing to marry her if she would agree to leave her husband Karenin, a government official, but she is vulnerable to the pressures of Russian social norms, her own insecurities and Karenin's indecision. Although Vronsky eventually takes Anna to Europe where they can be together, they have trouble making friends. Back in Russia, she is shunned, becoming further isolated and anxious, while Vronsky pursues his social life. Despite Vronsky's reassurances she grows increasingly possessive and paranoid about his imagined infidelity. About the Maude translation: the translation by Aylmer Maude (1858-1938) and Louise Shanks Maude (1855-1939) is highly considered by scholars. This unabridged and annotated translation from the original russian by Louise and Aylmer Maude was originally published in 1918. The Maudes are classical translators of Leo Tolstoy who worked directly with the author and gained his personal endorsement.",

A grande habilidade de Liev Tolstói em reconstruir, em seus livros, a sociedade moscovita do fim do século XIX atinge seu momento mais precioso em Ana Karenina. De longe, este foi seu livro mais popular desde o lançamento, em 1877, e o mais comentado pela crítica até a atualidade. Neste livro, o celebrado autor russo Liev Tolstói nos apresenta a história de Ana Karenina, uma mulher que se sente profundamente infeliz e frustrada no casamento. Ela enfrenta o julgamento cruel da alta sociedade ao assumir sua paixão por outro homem, um belo e jovem oficial, que lhe inspira uma paixão arrebatadora. As escolhas de Ana Karenina acabam por afastá-la de seu filho, o que, somado ao posterior desinteresse do amante, a coloca em uma situação sem saída, levando-a ao limite de seu próprio sustento emocional. Tolstói anuncia neste romance uma história de amor que desafia os costumes de sua época. Somos conduzidos, a partir das descrições ácidas que o tornaram um escritor mundialmente conhecido, por conflitos morais temperados com a ruína psicológica de Ana Karenina, o marido, Karenin, e o amante, conde Vronski. Publicada pela Editora José Olympio originalmente em 1943, esta tradução de Ana Karenina, realizada por Lúcio Cardoso, foi a primeira edição integral desta obra-prima no Brasil. Quase oitenta anos depois do lançamento, a Casa retoma esta festejada tradução para oferecer a leitoras e leitores brasileiros este texto singular, no qual vemos a rara aptidão de Lúcio Cardoso com a linguagem, sem deixar de lado o lirismo e o rigor técnico.. Esta edição, traduzida pelo aclamado escritor Lúcio Cardoso, conta com posfácio, preparação e cronologia de Ésio Macedo Ribeiro.",

    "description": "The must-have Pevear and Volokhonsky translation of one of the greatest Russian novels ever written Described by William Faulkner as the best novel ever written and by Fyodor Dostoevsky as “flawless,” Anna Karenina tells of the doomed love affair between the sensuous and rebellious Anna and the dashing officer, Count Vronsky. Tragedy unfolds as Anna rejects her passionless marriage and thereby exposes herself to the hypocrisies of society. Set against a vast and richly textured canvas of nineteenth-century Russia, the novel's seven major characters create a dynamic imbalance, playing out the contrasts of city and country life and all the variations on love and family happiness. While previous versions have softened the robust and sometimes shocking qualities of Tolstoy's writing, Pevear and Volokhonsky have produced a translation true to his powerful voice. This authoritative edition, which received the PEN Translation Prize and was an Oprah Book Club™ selection, also includes an illuminating introduction and explanatory notes. Beautiful, vigorous, and eminently readable, this Anna Karenina will be the definitive text for fans of the film and generations to come. This Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition also features French flaps and deckle-edged paper. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

    "description": "Jane Austen’s first published novel, Sense and Sensibility, is a witty satire of the sentimental novel, a popular genre in Britain throughout the 1790s and the Regency. When it first appeared in 1811, the words in its title carried significant cultural weight beyond the confines of the novel, and into both popular and learned discourse. Through her dual heroines, Austen addresses, and satirizes, notions of sense and sensibility, and engages with the issues of inheritance, marriage, and love. The story concerns two sisters: the level-headed Elinor and the passionate and impulsive Marianne. When their father dies, his son by a previous marriage assumes possession of the family home. Marianne and Elinor, left to the care of their mercenary brother John and his wife Fanny, must remove to a cottage with their mother. Each sister meets a man in whom she is interested, and as with other Austen novels, requited love does not come easily. This newly annotated edition offers a thorough and perceptive introduction and a wide range of carefully selected contextual materials that further explore the term “sensibility.”",

Why, fall in love, of course! Through her deft unraveling of the dramatically different romantic fates of Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, Jane Austen displays her singular mastery of the English language and her equally masterful invention of colorful and realistic characters. The author's appreciation of what it is to be human, grounded in her deeply convicted Christianity, illuminates the tale with special wisdom. In this, her first published novel, we see the sense and sensibility of Miss Austen herself, which combine to form the brilliance that shines forth in all of her works a brilliance enlivened by her remarkable sense of humor and the affectionate kindness that could only be born of a gracious Christian spirit.\"",

    "description": "Marianne Dashwood can’t understand her sister. How could the attractive, witty, and charming Elinor fall for the quiet, self-effacing, and rather dull Edward Ferrars? And, if the two are in love, why don’t they shout it to the world? Meanwhile, Elinor worries that Marianne’s heart-first approach to life will hurt her, especially when it comes to the dashing John Willoughby. The two sisters spar good-naturedly over the merits of full-blown emotionalism versus reticence and self-discipline in matters of the heart. Fond as they are of each other, each is certain that hers is the only true path to love. Meanwhile, both Edward and Willoughby harbor secrets that will force these women to doubt their philosophies, their judgment, and their chances for happiness. With Sense and Sensibility, her first published novel, Austen served notice that a new and important author had arrived—one whose style, wit, and piercing sense of satire supported a compelling story peopled with finely drawn characters and punctuated with remarkable insights into the human condition.",

Gatsby é apaixonado há anos por Daisy, uma aristocrata casada com o astro esportivo Tom Buchanan, e prima de Nick Carraway, um corretor de títulos que vive em Long Island, em uma casa vizinha à do protagonista. Ao ser enfim convidado para uma das festas da Gatsy, Nick se torna seu amigo e, por meio dessa relação, Gatsy busca se aproximar de Daisy na esperança de reatar o velho romance, agora que se tornou um homem rico e capaz de impressioná-la. O triângulo amoroso entre Daisy, Gatsy e Tom começa a ganhar ares de tensão até que culmina em uma sucessão de tragédias, revelando a verdadeira face dos personagens e da sociedade aristocrata norte-americana da década de 1920, marcada pela busca pelo glamour e pelo materialismo desenfreado. Escrito pelo célebre autor americano F. Scott Fitzgerald, O grande Gatsby é considerado uma das melhores obras literárias do século XX.",

    "description": "Now the subject of a major new film from director Baz Luhrmann (Romeo+Juliet, Moulin Rouge!), starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Carey Mulligan, The Great Gatsby is F. Scott Fitzgerald's brilliant fable of the hedonistic excess and tragic reality of 1920s America. This Penguin Classics edition is edited with an introduction and notes by Tony Tanner. Young, handsome and fabulously rich, Jay Gatsby is the bright star of the Jazz Age, but as writer Nick Carraway is drawn into the decadent orbit of his Long Island mansion, where the party never seems to end, he finds himself faced by the mystery of Gatsby's origins and desires. Beneath the shimmering surface of his life, Gatsby is hiding a secret: a silent longing that can never be fulfilled. And soon, this destructive obsession will force his world to unravel. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald brilliantly captures both the disillusionment of post-war America and the moral failure of a society obsessed with wealth and status. But he does more than render the essence of a particular time and place, for - in chronicling Gatsby's tragic pursuit of his dream - Fitzgerald re-creates the universal conflict between illusion and reality. Like Jay Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald (1896–1940) has acquired a mythical status in American literary history, and his masterwork The Great Gatsby is considered by many to be the 'great American novel'. In 1920 he married Zelda Sayre, dubbed 'the first American Flapper', and their traumatic marriage and Zelda's gradual descent into insanity became the leading influence on his writing. As well as many short stories, Fitzgerald wrote five novels This Side of Paradise, The Great Gatsby, The Beautiful and the Damned, Tender is the Night and, incomplete at the time of his death, The Last Tycoon. After his death The New York Times said of him that 'in fact and in the literary sense he created a \"generation\" '.

Com mais de 70 milhões de cópias vendidas desde seu lançamento em 1951, o livro influenciou e marcou gerações de leitores com sua visão crua da adolescência, sua prosa ágil e desbocada e seu humor feroz e anárquico. Esta nova edição que chega agora ao leitor brasileiro tem tradução do premiado Caetano W. Galindo e, pela primeira vez, traz a capa original de seu lançamento. É Natal, e Holden Caulfield conseguiu ser expulso de mais uma escola. Com uns trocados da venda de uma máquina de escrever e portando seu indefectível boné vermelho de caçador, o jovem traça um plano incerto: tomar um trem para Nova York e vagar por três dias pela grande cidade, adiando a volta à casa dos pais até que eles recebam a notícia da expulsão por alguém da escola. Seus dias e noites serão marcados por encontros confusos, e ocasionalmente comoventes, com estranhos, brigas com os tipos mais desprezíveis, encontros com ex-namoradas, visitas à sua irmã Phoebe -- a única criatura neste mundo que parece entendê-lo -- e por dúvidas que irão consumi-lo durante sua estadia, entre elas uma questão recorrente: afinal, para onde vão os patos do Central Park no inverno? Acima de todos esses fatos, preocupações e pensamentos, paira a inimitável voz de Holden, o adolescente raivoso e idealista que quer desbancar o mundo dos \"fajutos\", num turbilhão quase sem fim de ressentimento, humor, frases lapidares, insegurança, bravatas e rebelião juvenil.",

The Catcher in the Rye: New Essays presents a variety of new approaches to this extremely popular and intensely influential novel, ranging from the examination of the intertextual relationship between The Catcher in the Rye and Cormac McCarthy's All the Pretty Horses, to the evaluation of Salinger's mythic place in American film and popular culture, to the interrogation of what it means for a reader to claim that a novel such as The Catcher in the Rye has changed his or her life. These essays provide new commentary and new insights, and demonstrate the continuing relevance of Salinger, The Catcher in the Rye, and Holden Caulfield to American culture and literature and, in turn, to American cultural and literary studies.",

Romeu e Julieta, no entanto, logo se reconhecem como herdeiros de famílias rivais: os Montéquios e os Capuletos vêm há anos travando uma guerra sangrenta pelas ruas da cidade. Mas nada poderá impedir os dois de se entregarem de corpo e alma ao que sentem — um amor intenso e proibido que ao mesmo tempo os liberta e os condena. Escrito no fim do século XVI, durante uma das fases iniciais da produção de William Shakespeare (1564-1616), Romeu e Julieta se tornou um dos textos mais adorados entre os muitos clássicos do Bardo inglês. Romance e tragédia se mostram inseparáveis numa história que, tantas vezes revisitada nos palcos e nas telas, nunca falha em surpreender e fascinar. Esta edição conta com a primorosa tradução de Barbara Heliodora.",
